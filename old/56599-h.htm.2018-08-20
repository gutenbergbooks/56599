    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE TWO PICTURES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;A</span> Merry Christmas,
      and a Happy New Year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Words, of course, in themselves good and well-chosen, and embodying a wish
      which all who love their neighbour should feel and communicate;&mdash;God
      in his mercy grant there may be very many who can respond to such a
      salutation hopefully; for in this Valley of the Shadow of Death there must
      be some who shrink from it as from a bitter mockery. Of such are those
      who, loving deeply, have lost, or fear to lose, the object of their fond
      idolatry; of such are those to whom, gifted, perhaps, with an even wider
      capacity of affection, such a fear would seem a blessing, for then they
      would not have toiled through a lifetime lonely-hearted. &ldquo;A Merry
      Christmas, and a Happy New Year!&rdquo; God comfort those who shudder at such
      kindly greeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      One short month since, a little space of time, but more than long enough
      for the performance of many a deeper tragedy than that to which we are
      about to refer, an artist, glancing into the sunny breakfast-parlour of
      Ashburn Rectory, might have made a pretty picture of the group on which
      his eye would have fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That <i>gentleman</i> (in rags he would equally have looked such) with the
      calm, high forehead, mild eye, and earnest, thoughtful mouth, must be the
      father of the family; for his dark hair shows many a silver thread, and
      the lines that appear upon his still smooth brow can scarcely be the
      result of mental occupation only; but, if we are right in our conjecture,
      whence did that curly-pated nine-year-old urchin, seated upon his knee,
      contrive to get his arch, merry face? for he can scarcely have &ldquo;come
      alive&rdquo; out of one of Murillo&rsquo;s paintings, to give light and life to our
      family sketch. Oh! we see, it is his mother&rsquo;s countenance the rogue has
      appropriated, only the mischief in it is all his own; for the expression
      of her still-beautiful features is chastened and pensive, as of one who
      has lived and loved, and done angels&rsquo; work on earth, until the pure soul
      within has stamped its impress on the outward form.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you want something pretty&mdash;nay, we may as well tell the whole
      truth, and say at once bewitching&mdash;to look at, cast your eyes (you
      won&rsquo;t be in a hurry to remove them again) upon the figure seated at
      mamma&rsquo;s right hand, and recognising her facsimile (with twenty summers
      taken off her age, and barely eighteen left), declare whether that is not
      &ldquo;nice,&rdquo; rather. The expression is not the same, we confess: more of the
      woman and less of the angel, you will say. We admit it; but then, how
      could that little rosebud of a mouth look anything but petulant? those
      violet eyes express&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell what they don&rsquo;t
      express that is good, and fresh, and piquant, and gay, and&mdash;must we
      add? a little bit coquettish also;&mdash;why, the very dimple on her chin&mdash;such
      a well-modelled chin&mdash;has something pert and saucy about it. There!
      you&rsquo;ve seen enough of the little beauty: you&rsquo;ll be falling in love with
      her directly!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could mistake the relationship existing between the gentleman we
      have already described, and that tall, graceful boy, with his pale,
      finely-chiselled features, and classically-shaped head. Even the earnest,
      thoughtful expression is common to both father and son, save that the curl
      of the short upper lip, which tells of pride in the boy, has, in the man,
      acquired a character of chastened dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, do you like our picture? Let us turn to another, less pleasing,
      but alas! equally true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waves of time roll on, and, like a dream, another month has lapsed
      into the sea of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun is shining still; but it shines upon an open grave, with aching
      hearts around it. A good man has died, and his brave, loving spirit has
      gone whither his faith has preceded him, and his good works alone can
      follow him. &ldquo;Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let us reserve our sympathy for those who live to mourn them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the curate of Ashburn preached a funeral sermon, recalling to the
      minds of those who had practically benefited by them the virtues of their
      late rector, holly garlands hung in the fine old church, to commemorate
      the birth-time of One who came to bring &ldquo;peace on earth, and good-will
      towards men;&rdquo; but none dared to wish the widow and orphans &ldquo;A Merry
      Christmas, and a Happy New Year,&rdquo; lest the wish might seem an insult to
      their sorrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE BROTHERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;P</span>ercy, I <i>have</i>
      been quiet <i>so</i> long, and you say I must not stand upon my head,
      because it disturbs mamma; do come out and let us ride the pony by turns,&rdquo;
       implored little Hugh Colville in a strenuous whisper; which was, however,
      clearly audible throughout the small breakfast-parlour, which was the
      scene of our family picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy Colville, the shy, handsome boy of our sketch, looked up with a
      pensive smile from the writing on which he was engaged, and shook his head
      negatively, in token that he felt obliged to refuse the request of his
      younger brother, in whom the reader will recognise, with little
      difficulty, a certain Murillo-like urchin to whom he has been already
      introduced. But the petition of her youngest born had reached the ears of
      the widow, who (if she had a virtue which had outgrown its due proportions
      till cavillers might deem it a fault), was, perhaps, a little over
      indulgent to Master Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Percy, you have been writing for me long enough,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
      will be ill if you shut yourself up too much; besides, Hugh has been so
      good that he deserves his ride, and you know I don&rsquo;t like to trust him by
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy hesitated: the writing on which he was engaged was the copy of a
      surveyor&rsquo;s report concerning that <i>vexata quaestic</i>, dilapidations.
      Some difference of opinion had arisen on this subject between the agent of
      the patron of the living and Mrs. Colville&rsquo;s solicitor, and a copy of the
      report was to be forwarded by the next post to Mr. Wakefield, Mrs.
      Calville&rsquo;s legal adviser. The matter was of importance, involving a
      considerable sum of money. Percy was aware of these facts: he knew, also,
      that he could only just finish his task by the time the village post went
      out; and he was about to declare that Hugh must give up his ride for that
      day, when his mother, reading his thoughts-, stooped over him, and,
      kissing his pale brow, whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not refuse him, dear Percy: remember, he will not have many more rides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, for her composure was failing, then finished in a trembling
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the pony must be sold when we go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, an expedient suggested itself to Percy&rsquo;s mind, and pressing
      his mother&rsquo;s hand affectionately, he closed his writing-desk, and,
      carrying it off under his arm, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Come along, Hugh! we&rsquo;ll
      take old Lion (he wants a run, poor dog) as well as the pony, and have a
      glorious scamper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a glorious scamper they had, only Hugh rode the whole way, and Percy
      ran by his side, declaring that he greatly preferred it, which was
      decidedly a pious fiction, if a fiction can ever be pious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mamma, mamma! do make breakfast&mdash;come, quick! there&rsquo;s a good
      mamma! for I&rsquo;m as hungry as&mdash;as&mdash;several sharks,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Hugh, rushing like a small express train into the breakfast-parlour, on
      the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you naughty mad-cap, you&rsquo;ve shaken the table, and made me blot &lsquo;That
      Smile&rsquo; all over!&rdquo; cried his sister Emily, in vain endeavouring to repair
      the misfortune which had accrued to the &ldquo;popular melody&rdquo; she was copying.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suppose it is scarcely necessary to reintroduce you to Emily, dear
      reader. You have not so soon forgotten the rosebud of a mouth, or the
      dangerous dimple&mdash;trust you for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare, so I have,&rdquo; rejoined the culprit, a little shocked and a
      good deal amused at the mischief he had occasioned; then striking into the
      tune of the outraged ditty, he sang in an impish soprano, and with
      grimaces wonderful to behold&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That smile&mdash;when once&mdash;de-par-ar-ar-arted,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Must leave&mdash;me bro&mdash;ken har-ar-ir-arted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Emily, what a mess we have made of &lsquo;broken-hearted,&rsquo; to be sure I&rsquo;m
      so sorry, but what fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then came a burst of ringing, happy, childish laughter, which, of
      course, sealed his forgiveness: no one could think him to blame after <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where Percy is; I scarcely ever knew him late before,&rdquo; observed
      Mrs. Colville, when quiet had been restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah tells me he is out riding,&rdquo; returned Emily, applying herself with
      very unnecessary energy to cut bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the clatter of horses&rsquo; feet became audible, and, in another
      moment, Percy cantered past the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can the boy have been?&rdquo; ejaculated Emily, holding the loaf
      lovingly, as though she was afraid of hurting the poor thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I do!&rdquo; observed Hugh, from under the table, whence, having in his
      mind&rsquo;s eye metamorphosed himself into a wolf, he was preparing to spring
      out and devour Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> know, Hugh!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Colville in surprise; &ldquo;come from
      under the table, then, and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma, I&rsquo;m a wolf, and just going to eat up Emily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, dear,&rdquo; was the calm reply, as if a daughter more or less
      devoured by wild beasts was of little moment to that un-anxious mother;
      &ldquo;come here, and tell me about Percy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, mamma,&rdquo; began Hugh, emerging from his hiding-place, and
      assuming the grave air of a <i>raconteur</i>, &ldquo;when Percy came to bed last
      night, he did not go to bed at all&mdash;that is, not for a very, very,
      very long time. Do you know, I think&rdquo;&mdash;and here he put on a solemn
      face, and spoke with an air of mystery&mdash;&ldquo;I think he was not in bed at
      twelve o&rsquo;clock, perhaps not till almost one!&rdquo; Having disclosed this
      frightful fact, he paused and nodded like a bird, for the greater effect,
      ere he continued: &ldquo;I went to sleep long before, but, whenever I opened my
      eyes, there he sat, still write, write, writing on, as if he was writing
      his life, like Robinson Crusoe&mdash;only,&rdquo; he added, parenthetically&mdash;&ldquo;only
      he&rsquo;s got no man Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could he be writing?&rdquo; exclaimed Emily, coquetting with the large
      bread-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; resumed Hugh; then, having paused to balance himself on one leg,
      and spin round like a teetotum, he continued very fast, and without any
      stops, for Percy&rsquo;s footsteps sounded in the hall: &ldquo;he was writing the
      paper he had not time to finish yesterday, because I wanted him to go out
      with me and the pony; and this morning he got up at six o&rsquo;clock to ride
      over to Staplehurst, seven miles there, and I don&rsquo;t know how many back
      again, to catch the post, and make it all the same as if it had been put
      in yesterday; I know he did, because Sarah says so.&rdquo; And, having delivered
      himself with the greatest vehemence of this somewhat incoherent account,
      he rushed up to his brother, then entering the room, and, throwing his arm
      as round his waist, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Percy! I&rsquo;ve gone and told them all
      about your great letter, and sitting up late, and everything, and never
      remembered till now that you said I wasn&rsquo;t to mention it to anybody. Oh, I
      am so sorry, but what fun!&rdquo; and, assured by the expression of Percy&rsquo;s face
      that his crime was not quite unpardonable, Hugh&rsquo;s merry, childish laugh
      again rang through the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother&rsquo;s heart was full: tears stood in her eyes as, pressing her
      elder son to her bosom, she murmured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Percy, you must not overtask your strength thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The post that morning brought the following letter directed to Mrs.
      Colville:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sister,&mdash;That I have the will to aid you in your distress
      you cannot doubt; that the power to do so effectually is denied me, adds
      one more to the troubles of life. My imprudent marriage (he had run away
      with a pretty governess at eighteen), and its subsequent consequences (he
      had nine healthy children), force me to work like a horse in a mill, in
      order to make both ends meet. Of this I am not complaining.. I did an
      unwise thing, and must pay the necessary penalty. But I mention these
      facts to prove to you the truth of my assertion, that my power is not
      coequal with my will. The little I can do is this: I am shareholder in an
      excellent proprietary school, where boys are taught everything necessary
      to fit them for a commercial life; Wilfred Jacob has been there two years,
      and is already conversant with, or, as he familiarly terms it, &lsquo;well up
      in&rsquo; tare and tret. I trust Adolphus Samuel, Albert John, Thomas Gabriel,
      and even the little Augustus Timothy, will soon follow, and profit
      equally. I therefore propose to send your two boys to this school at my
      own cost; and, if the eldest distinguishes himself, as I am proud to
      believe Wilfred Jacob will do, a desk in my counting-house (No. 8,
      Grubbinger Street, City) shall reward his diligence. Clementina Jane
      desires her kindest regards, and begs me to say that, should you finally
      determine upon settling in London, she shall have much pleasure in looking
      out a cheap lodging for you in some of the least expensive streets in the
      vicinity of Smithfield. I am, dear Margaret, ever your affectionate
      brother,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goldsmith and Thryft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;So much for habit: I have become so accustomed to sign for the
      firm, that I actually forget that my name is Tobiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville closed the letter, with a sigh, and placing it in her
      pocket, waited till the boys had breakfasted. As soon as they had quitted
      the room she handed it to her daughter, saving. &ldquo;Read that, dear Emily: it
      is very kind of your uncle, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percy at a desk in Grubbinger Street! Oh, my dearest mamma, what a
      dreadful idea!&rdquo; exclaimed the Rosebud, arching her brows, and pursing up
      her pretty little mouth with an expression of the most intense
      disapproval: &ldquo;Uncle Tobiah means to be very kind, but he forgets what
      Percy is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville shook her head mournfully. &ldquo;I am afraid it is we who forget,
      love,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Percy can no longer hope to pursue the career marked out
      for him&mdash;with the very limited means at my disposal, college is quite
      out of the question; nay, if Sir Thomas Crawley persists in his demand for
      the incoming tenant&rsquo;s claim to these dilapidations, and should prove his
      right to it, I shall be unable to send the boys to school at all; indeed,
      I must not reject your uncle&rsquo;s offer rashly. I shall consult Mr. Slowkopf
      on the subject; he is a very prudent adviser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you mean to ask <i>him</i>, the matter is as good as settled, and
      poor Percy chained to a desk for life,&rdquo; cried Emily. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she continued,
      as a tall, thin, gaunt figure, clothed in rusty black, passed the window,
      &ldquo;here he comes&mdash;the creature always puts me in mind of that naughty
      proverb about a certain person: one no sooner mentions him than there he
      is at one&rsquo;s elbow;&mdash;but, if you really want to talk sense to him,
      mamma dear, I&rsquo;d better go, for I shall only say pert things and disturb
      you: he is so delightfully slow and matter-of-fact, that I never can
      resist the temptation of plaguing him;&rdquo; and as she spoke, the Rosebud
      laughed a little silvery laugh at her own wickedness, and tripped,
      fairy-like, out of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Mr. Slowkopf, who had held the office of curate of Ashburn for
      about two years, was a very good young man, and nothing else; all his
      other qualities were negative. He wasn&rsquo;t even positively a fool, though he
      looked and acted the part admirably. He was essentially, and in every
      sense of the word, a slow man: in manners, ideas, and appearance, he was
      behind the age in which he lived; in conversation he was behind the
      subject discussed; if he laughed at a joke, which, solemnly and heavily,
      he sometimes condescended to do, it was invariably ten minutes after it
      had been made. He never heard of Puseyism till Tract Ninety had been
      suppressed, or knew of the persecutions and imprisonments of Dr. Achilli
      till that amateur martyr was crying aloud for sympathy in Exeter Hall; he
      usually finished his fish when the cheese was being put on table; and went
      to bed as other people were getting up. Still, he had his good points.
      Unlike King Charles, of naughty memory,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Who never said a foolish thing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And never did a wise one,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      however dull and trite might be Mr. Slowkopf&rsquo;s remarks, his actions were
      invariably good and kind. The village gossips, when they were very hard-up
      for scandal, declared that, insensible as he appeared to all such
      frivolities as the fascinations of the softer sex, he was gradually taking
      a &ldquo;slow turn&rdquo; towards the Rosebud of Ashburn. Nay, the rumour was reported
      to have reached the delicate ears of the &ldquo;emphatic she&rdquo; herself; who was
      said to have replied, that as she was quite certain he would never dream
      of telling his love till he heard she was engaged to be married to some
      one else&mdash;in which case she should have a legitimate reason for
      refusing him&mdash;the information did not occasion her the slightest
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this might be, certain it is, that on the morning in question, Mr.
      Slowkopf, gaunt, ugly, and awkward, solemnly walked into the
      breakfast-parlour, and that the widow, perplexed between her good sense
      and her loving tenderness for her children, laid before him her
      difficulties and her brother&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curate paused about three times as long as was necessary, and then, in
      a deep, sepulchral voice, observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to attain to a sound and logical conclusion in regard to this
      weighty matter, it behoves me first to assure myself that I rightly
      comprehend the question propounded, and if, as I conceive, it prove to be
      one which will not admit of demonstration with a mathematical certainty;
      then, secondly, so to compare the different hypotheses which may present
      themselves, that, sufficient weight being allotted to each, a just and
      philosophical decision may be finally arrived at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having, after this preamble, stated the case in language as precise and
      carefully selected as though he were framing a bill to lay before
      Parliament, and were resolved to guard against <i>the</i> possibility of
      the most astute legal Jehu driving a coach and four through it, he argued
      the matter learnedly and steadily for a good half-hour, ere he dug out the
      ore of common sense from the mass of logical rubbish beneath which he had
      buried it, and decided in favour of Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s proposal. Pleased at
      his own cleverness in having solved this difficult problem, and possessing
      unlimited confidence in his oratorical powers, he volunteered to
      communicate the decision thus formed to the person most nearly concerned
      therein, an offer to which Mrs. Colville, feeling her strength unequal to
      the task, reluctantly consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy listened in silence till Mr. Slowkopf had talked himself out of
      breath, which it took him some time to accomplish, for, in every sense of
      the term, he was awfully long-winded; when at length he was silent, the
      boy fixed his large eyes earnestly upon his face as he replied, &ldquo;I
      understand, sir, we are so poor that it is not possible to send me to a
      public school, or to college as&mdash;as&mdash;my dear father wished; but
      I do not see why I am necessarily obliged to become a merchant&rsquo;s clerk, a
      position which I shall never be fit for, and which I hate the idea of; the
      Colvilles have always been gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man may work for his living in some honest occupation without
      forfeiting that title,&rdquo; returned Mr. Slowkopf, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a merchant&rsquo;s clerk,&rdquo; was the haughty reply: &ldquo;No; let me be an
      artist, if I cannot receive a gentleman&rsquo;s education in England. I know I
      have some talent for drawing, let me study that, and then go to Italy,
      beautiful Italy, for a few years; people can live very cheaply abroad, and
      I will be very careful. When I become famous I shall grow rich, and be
      able to support mamma, and send Hugh to college, and then I shall care
      less for not having been there myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without attempting to regard your scheme in its many complicated
      bearings, or to argue the matter in its entire completeness, for which
      time, unfortunately, is wanting,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Slowkopf, deliberately; &ldquo;I
      will place before you, <i>in limine</i>, certain objections to it which
      render the commercial career proposed by your excellent uncle, if not in
      every point a more advantageous arrangement, at all events one more suited
      to the present position of affairs. Your uncle proposes to take upon
      himself all immediate expense connected with your education; while, as a
      clerk in his counting-house, you will be in the receipt of a gradually
      increasing salary. Your scheme would demand a constant outlay of capital,
      for certainly the next five years; nay, it would be no matter of surprise
      to me if ten years should elapse, ere, by the precarious earnings of an
      artist&rsquo;s career, you were enabled to render yourself independent. In one
      case you will be an assistance to your excellent mother, in the other a
      burden upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy walked to the window; the burning tears of disappointed ambition and
      mortified pride rushed to his eyes, but he brushed them hurriedly away, as
      he said in a firm, steady voice, &ldquo;Thank you for telling me the truth, Mr.
      Slowkopf; we will accept my uncle&rsquo;s offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came about that Percy and Hugh Colville were entered, as boarders,
      at Doctor Donkiestir&rsquo;s excellent proprietary establishment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Rosebud of
      Ashburn possessed a female friend. Caroline Selby was the daughter of Sir
      Thomas Crawley&rsquo;s agent. Sir Thomas Crawley was the rich man of the
      neighbourhood, lord of the manor, patron of the living, and owner of a
      splendid place about a mile from the village; but although Ashburn Priory
      was an old family seat, the present owner of the property had by no means
      always been the great man he was at present; indeed, it may be doubted
      whether, in justice, he had any right to be so at all; though,
      unfortunately, in law he possessed a very sufficient one. The former
      possessor of Ashburn Priory, an irritable, perverse old man, had, in a
      moment of passion, disinherited an only son (who had committed the
      unpardonable crime of consulting his heart, rather than his pocket, in the
      choice of a wife), making a will in favour of a relative whom he had never
      seen, and of whom the little he had heard was unfavourable. It is true, he
      never intended this will to take effect; meaning, when he had sufficiently
      consulted his dignity, and marked his disapproval of the sin against
      Mammon which his son had committed, graciously to receive him into favour
      again; but Death, who has no more respect for ill-temper than for many
      more amiable qualities, did not allow him time to repair the injustice he
      had committed, cutting him off with an attack of bronchitis, and his son
      with a shilling, at one fell stroke. The son, an amiable man, with a large
      family (a conjunction so often to be observed, that, to a speculative
      mind, it almost assumes the relation of cause and effect), soon spent his
      shilling, and, overtasking his strength to replace it, ere long followed
      his unjust father, though we can scarcely imagine that he travelled by the
      same road. Before this latter event took place, however, Mr. Thomas
      Crawley made his first appearance as lord of the manor of Ashburn, and
      master of the Priory; and everybody was so well aware what he was, that
      they carefully abstained from inquiring what he had been. To those capable
      of judging, however, one thing was unmistakably apparent; namely, that
      neither in the past nor in the present could his manners and appearance
      entitle him to the designation of a gentleman. That he himself entertained
      an uncomfortable suspicion of this fact, might be gathered from the
      indefatigable perseverance with which he pursued the object of attaining
      to the rank of knighthood. Up the rounds of a ladder of gold he climbed
      into Parliament; once there, if he voted according to his conscience, that
      inward monitor must have been of a decidedly versatile temperament; for
      the way in which he wheeled about, and turned about, on every occasion,
      conceivable and inconceivable, was without precedent, save in the cases of
      Jim Crow of giddy memory, and of Weathercock <i>versus</i> Boreas and Co.
      At last a crisis arrived; votes were worth more than the men who gave
      them: a minister stayed in who should have gone out; and Mr. Crawley
      became Sir Thomas. And this was the man who, with a rent-roll of Â£15,000
      a-year, was about to avail himself of a legal quibble, in order to extort
      from a widow and orphans a share of the little pittance that remained to
      them. His agent Mr. Selby, was a better man than his master; and might
      have been better still, if &ldquo;his poverty, and not his will,&rdquo; had not led
      him to consent to be the instrument wherewith Sir Thomas Crawley, M.P.,
      transacted much dirty work in Ashburn and its vicinity. At the time we
      treat of the will had so often yielded that it had quite lost the habit of
      asserting itself; and the poverty, profiting by this inertness, had
      gradually disappeared, till Mr. Selby was generally looked upon as a man
      well to do in the world, and respected accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this brings us back to the point from whence we originally started;
      namely, that the Rosebud of Ashburn possessed a female friend. Now, the
      office of female friend to a Rosebud, romantic and poetical as it sounds,
      was by no means a sinecure; indeed, from the confidant of Tilburnia
      downwards, these sympathisers of all work have hard places of it. Still,
      there appears to be no lack of amiable creatures ready to devote
      themselves to the cause of friendship; the supply seems always to equal
      the demand. Possibly occasional perquisites, in the shape of a heart
      caught in the rebound, as in the case of a discarded lover, or the
      reversion of some <i>bon parti</i>, rejected for a more eligible offer,
      may have something to do with it&mdash;of this we cannot pretend to judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That any such sordid notions influenced Caroline Selby in her devotion to
      Emily Colville, we do not believe: on the contrary, the friendship arose
      from, and was cemented by, the Jack-Sprat-and-his-wife-like suitableness
      of their respective natures; Caroline having a decided call to look up to
      and worship somebody, while Emily experienced an equally strenuous
      necessity for being worshipped and looked up to. But the Rosebud was
      subject also to other necessities, which effectually preserved her friend
      from falling into the snares of idleness. First, she had a chronic
      necessity for &ldquo;talking confidence,&rdquo;&mdash;though how, in the quiet village
      of Ashburn, she contrived to obtain a supply of mysteries to furnish forth
      subjects for these strictly private colloquies, was the greatest mystery
      of all. Then privy councils were held upon dress, in all its branches,
      from staylaces up to <i>blonde Berthes</i>; and committees of ways and
      means had to combat and arrange financial difficulties. Again, the affairs
      of their poorer neighbours required much talking about, and speculating
      upon; and their little charities Nor, despite sundry small weaknesses and
      frivolities natural to their age, or rather youth, and sex, the friends
      were thoroughly kind-hearted, amiable girls, could not be planned, or
      executed, without a <i>necessary</i> amount of conversation. Then there
      was a town, three miles off by the road, and two and a half by the fields,
      where everything came from; for, though Ashburn boasted a &ldquo;general&rdquo; shop,
      yet those who were rash enough to particularise any article they might
      require, beyond the inevitable bacon, cheese, soap, bad tea, worse sugar,
      starch, and; hobnailed shoes, upon which agricultural life is supported,
      only prepared for themselves a disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This obliging town the Rosebud had a call to visit, on an average, three
      times a week at the very least; and of course, when the pony-chaise could
      not be had, which&mdash;as Hugh, by the agency of that much-enduring pony,
      existed rather as a centaur than a biped&mdash;was almost always the case,
      Caroline Selby was required as a walking companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus enlightened the reader as to the nature of the friendship
      existing between these young ladies, together with other particulars,
      which, at the risk of being considered prosy, we felt bound to communicate
      to him, we resume the thread of our narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks had elapsed since Mrs. Colville had accepted her brother&rsquo;s
      offer, and the day approached when Percy and Hugh were to quit the home of
      their happy childhood, never again to return to it. Mrs. Colville seldom
      alluded to the subject; busying herself in preparing their clothes, and in
      other necessary duties appertaining to the mistress of a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that Master Hugh wore turn-over collars, famous for two
      peculiarities, viz., the moment they were put on, clean and smooth, they
      became rumpled and dirty&mdash;and the strings by which they were
      fastened, were the victims to a suicidal propensity for tearing themselves
      violently off, so that the amount of starch, labour, and tape, required to
      preserve these collars in an efficient condition, formed a serious item in
      the household expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the excellent factotum, Sarah, declared upon oath (not a <i>very</i>
      naughty one) that she had reviewed the delinquents cautiously that day
      fortnight, and been able to report them fitted for service, yet, at the
      eleventh hour, when she was actually packing Hugh&rsquo;s box, there were only
      three strings and a quarter remaining among the twelve collars, and there
      was no reliance to be placed even upon them. Moreover, on examination,
      there was discovered to have been such a run upon tape, of late, that not
      an inch of that useful article was forthcoming throughout the entire
      establishment. Under these appalling circumstances, Emily nobly
      volunteered to go to Flatville, and invest capital in the purchase of a
      &ldquo;whole piece of tape.&rdquo; But the boys were absent on a skating expedition;
      and the roads were slippery, and the pony had not been roughed, and Emily,
      not liking to walk by herself, set off, no way loth, to enlist Caroline
      Selby as her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, a difficulty arose. Mr. Selby was just starting in his
      phaeton, to drive over to the railroad station, two miles beyond
      Flatville, and his daughter was going with him, for the sake of a drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline was perplexed: had it been only to give up her own plans, she
      would gladly have done so; but between her father and her friend, a double
      sacrifice was required of her, and being only a single woman, she was
      unable to meet the demand. Mr. Selby, happily, hit upon an expedient. He
      proposed a compromise: Miss Colville should do him the honour to take a
      seat in his phaeton (he called it ph<i>ee-a</i>ton), <i>he</i> would drive
      her as far as Flatville; his <i>daughter</i> should alight with her: they
      should make their <i>little</i> purchases (the words in italics he uttered
      in a tone of the tenderest affection); and the ph<i>ee-a</i>ton, in
      returning from the station, should call and pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Selby was a very polite man; and perpetually rubbed his hands
      together, as though he were playing at washing them, a habit possibly
      induced by a consciousness of all the dirty work he had performed. Emily
      patronised him, steadily disbelieving everything that was hinted against
      him, because he was Caroline&rsquo;s father,&mdash;a piece of scepticism,
      amiable, illogical, and womanly, which we rather admire in the young lady
      than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, favouring him with a bewitching smile, that a better man than
      he might have been proud to win, she scarcely touched the hand he held out
      to assist her (which he carefully dry-washed afterwards, as though the
      contact even of her fairy fingers had dissolved the spell of its prudish
      purity), and sprang lightly into the &ldquo;ph<i>ee-a</i>ton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour&rsquo;s drive brought them to Flatville, where Mr. Selby, so to
      speak, washed his hands of them, and went on to the railroad station. Then
      began the shopping, that most mysterious and deeply-seated passion of the
      female heart&mdash;the one master vice which serves the ladies of England,
      instead of the turf, the wine-cup, and the gaming table, which mislead
      their lords. There can be little doubt who first invented shopping! The
      same hand which launched that arrow into the bosom of private life, gave
      to the child-woman, Eve, the apple that betrayed her&mdash;an apple which
      contained the seeds of shopping. It is such a seductive, hypocritical sin,
      too, this same shopping&mdash;one which is so easily dressed up to
      resemble a virtue&mdash;that it is almost impossible to distinguish its
      true character <i>till the bill comes in</i>: that, like the touch of
      Ithuriel&rsquo;s spear, reveals the fiend in all its deformity. Every woman
      (that we have known) is more or less addicted to this ruinous practice,
      but some appear especially gifted with the fatal talent, and, if the truth
      must be told, our little heroine was one of these unfortunates. The amount
      of shopping she would contrive to get, even out of a piece of tape, was
      fearful to reflect upon. In the first place, it was to be of a particular
      (<i>very</i> particular) texture, neither too coarse nor too fine; then
      society would probably be uprooted, and the Thames be set on fire, if it
      were a shade too wide, or, worse still, too narrow. Again, tape was
      useless without needles and thread, wherewith to operate upon it; and for
      some time&mdash;indeed, till the obsequious parrot of a shopman had gone
      through his whole vocabulary of persuasion, and become cynical and
      monosyllabic&mdash;<i>all</i> the needles were too large; and, that
      difficulty being overcome, the thread (sewing cotton Emily called it) took
      a perverse turn, and would by no means sympathise with the eyes of the
      selected needles, till the harassed shopman muttered a private aspiration
      in regard to those useful orifices, which would have cost him five
      shillings in any court of justice. But he took his revenge, did that
      cunning shopman, for, no sooner had Emily bought all that she required,
      than he suddenly recovered his good humour and loquacity, and placed
      before her exactly the very articles she most desired, and had not funds
      to purchase withal, till Tantalus himself might have appeared a gentleman
      who lived at home at ease, in comparison with that sorely-tempted
      &ldquo;Rose-bud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, what woman could do, she did, for she firmly resisted everything,
      till an unlucky remnant of magpie-coloured ribbon, the &ldquo;very thing she
      should want when she changed her mourning, and which she <i>knew</i> she
      could never meet with again,&rdquo; a ribbon so cheap that the shopman declared
      he was &ldquo;giving it away,&rdquo; at the very moment when he was adding two
      shillings to the bill on the strength of it; though this reductive ribbon
      beguiled her, the little concession only proved that she was not above
      humanity. With which fact we are well contented, because, enjoying but a
      very distant and limited acquaintance with such higher circles as she
      would otherwise have mixed in, we might never have heard of her existence,
      That she possessed some power of self-denial she proved, by paying her
      bill and quitting the shop the moment that ribbon had conquered her; the
      next best thing to resisting temptation being to fly from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Caroline dear, we must have been an age in that shop, it is nearly
      five o&rsquo;clock! What can have become of your father&rsquo;s carriage?&rdquo; exclaimed
      Emily, glancing in dismay at the hands of the old church clock, which
      pointed to a quarter to five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really I can&rsquo;t conceive,&rdquo; was the reply: &ldquo;something must have occurred to
      delay it, I suppose; it will be growing dusk before we can get home if we
      have to walk by the road, and we can scarcely attempt the fields so late
      by ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma will be so frightened,&rdquo; suggested Emily, &ldquo;if it gets at all dark
      before we return&mdash;had we not better start at once, and walk on till
      the carriage overtakes us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caroline agreed to this plan, merely proposing the emendation that they
      should leave word they had done so, and that the groom, if he ever
      appeared, was to follow and endeavour to overtake them. For this purpose
      they re-entered the linen-draper&rsquo;s shop, where, while they paused for a
      moment to deliver the message, that vindictive shopman actually was
      scoundrel enough to display at arm&rsquo;s length a flimsy black scarf (<i>barege</i>
      we believe the villain called it), which, down to the very pattern itself
      (opaque spots of the same material, representing apparently a turnip with
      a cocked hat on, though we can scarcely bring ourselves to believe the
      draughtsman could seriously have thus planned the design), Emily had
      dreamed of only the night before: such is the heartlessness of men&mdash;at
      least of shopmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls, having nobly withstood the scarf, started energetically on
      their homeward walk, nor were their tongues less active than their feet,
      but then they had so much to talk about. The linen-draper&rsquo;s stock was
      first done ample justice to; that &ldquo;dear&rdquo; silver grey <i>mousseline de soie</i>,
      which wasn&rsquo;t dear at all, but as cheap as&mdash;(the ribbon, perhaps, on
      which the shop-keeper only realised some fifty per cent., but then it was
      a remnant, and given away)&mdash;and then those gloves, French kid, oh!
      they must have been smuggled; how wrong it was to smuggle, at least papa
      (Selby) always said so, but really the price was quite ridiculous; didn&rsquo;t
      Emily think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily did not know about its being ridiculous, but it was dreadfully
      tempting; and if she had not made up her mind irrevocably against changing
      any one of the three sovereigns she had in her purse, and which must last
      her for pocket-money for the next two months, she should decidedly have
      bought a pair, really, for the sake of economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fruitful and edifying topic lasted them a good mile and a half, and
      was not yet exhausted, when Emily interrupted herself by exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Upon
      my word it&rsquo;s growing quite dusk; I wonder whether that carriage is ever
      coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so, for I&rsquo;m getting dreadfully frightened; ah! what&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo; replied her companion with a sudden start; &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s only a post,
      how silly I am! I declare I thought it was a man with a pistol hooked&mdash;no&mdash;what
      is it they call it when they&rsquo;re dangerous and mean to go off, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cocked,&rdquo; returned Emily; &ldquo;but surely that is a man, and a very
      uncomfortable looking one too; walk on quickly, and seem as if you did not
      perceive him; perhaps he may not take any notice of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advice was sound, but, unfortunately, the plan did not prove as
      successful as it deserved to be; the individual in question, who, when
      they first came in sight, was lying apparently asleep upon some fallen
      timber by the road-side, rose as they came near, and approaching them,
      began in a tone half-impertinent, half-imploring, to beg of them. He was a
      stout, ruffianly-looking fellow, dressed in a style which accorded with
      his profession. The poor girls were considerably frightened: they were
      quite a mile from Ashburn, in a lonely part of the road; the evening was
      closing in rapidly, and there was no human being in sight, except their
      persecutor, who, walking beside them, grew every minute more pertinacious
      and imperative. With a most transparent attempt at dignified composure,
      Emily drew out her purse, and, taking a shilling from it, handed it to
      him, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that is as much as we shall give you, so you need not follow us
      any further&mdash;good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking the shilling, with a look of sulky dissatisfaction, the fellow
      paused for a moment in irresolution; but, unfortunately, when Emily
      produced her purse, his eye had caught the sparkle of gold, and his
      cupidity was too deeply excited to be so easily satisfied: looking up and
      down the road, to assure himself that no one was at hand to interfere with
      his designs, he again followed the trembling girls; and, coming up with
      them, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! will you only give a poor fellow that&rsquo;s starving, a shilling? and
      you with a purse full of money in your pocket&mdash;and you calls
      yourselves ladies too? It would only serve you right to show you that
      ladies was no better than other people.&rdquo; As he spoke, he pressed rudely
      against Caroline Selby, who, shrinking from him, whispered in an agony of
      terror&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily, what <i>will</i> become of us? Pray give him some more money, and
      entreat him to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, Emily again drew forth her purse, and, trembling at her own
      temerity, said in an authoritative tone of voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s half-a-crown for you, and now go away, and don&rsquo;t annoy us any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without something better worth taking with me,&rdquo; was the insolent
      reply, as, catching her wrist, he attempted to force the purse from her
      grasp; but Emily, although greatly alarmed, had a brave little heart of
      her own, and held on stoutly, till the unmanly ruffian, provoked at her
      pertinacity, used so much force that she relinquished the purse; while at
      the same moment, partly through pain, partly through fright, she uttered
      piercing scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, albeit insolent lords of the creation exulting in strong nerves, and
      not possessing soprano voices, are accustomed to regard screaming as a
      feeble-minded practice, equally useless and ridiculous, yet in the
      instance before us it proved of the highest benefit, and by far the best
      thing, which, under the circumstances, Emily could have done; for, as if
      he were some good genius evoked by the Rosebud&rsquo;s appeal, suddenly and
      unexpectedly a tall, agile figure sprang through a gap in the hedge,
      cleared the intervening space at a bound, and, almost before the footpad
      was aware of his approach, struck the scoundrel, with a stick which he
      carried, so severe a blow over the knuckles, that he dropped the purse;
      while, at the same moment, seizing him by the throat, he forced him
      backwards, and, putting out his leg, tripped him up, and flung him heavily
      to the ground. Placing his foot upon the breast of his fallen foe, to
      prevent his rising, he turned towards the frightened girls, find, lifting
      his hat courteously, thereby revealing his dark chestnut curls, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, ladies, I am quite able to protect you.&rdquo; Then,
      pointing to the fallen man with his stick, which he slightly shook at him
      with a menacing gesture, he continued&mdash;&ldquo;Has the scoundrel robbed you
      of anything but the purse?&rdquo; As she turned to answer, Emily raised her eyes
      to the speaker&rsquo;s face. He was young, apparently not more than five or six
      and twenty; the exertion he had undergone had caused a bright flush to
      overspread his usually pale features; even at that moment his look was
      calm and spiritual; the prevailing expression of his face was power, which
      revealed itself in his flashing eyes and stern, compressed mouth; his
      voice, when he spoke, sounded peculiarly rich and sweet. When Emily had
      informed him that, with the exception of the purse, they had sustained no
      loss, he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was struggling with you when I came up; he must, surely, have hurt
      you; are you quite uninjured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the gils having assured him that they were merely frightened, and
      that until the moment before he appeared, the man had simply been begging
      of them, the stranger turned to his prostrate foe, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would only serve you right for your unmanly attack on two defenceless
      women, if I were to avail myself of the advantage I have gained over you
      to take you into custody and have you punished for the offence you have
      committed; but as I wish to spare these ladies the alarm of witnessing any
      further struggle between us, I shall, with their permission, let you go;
      but mind this, I shall give a description of your appearance at the
      nearest police-station; and if you do not immediately quit this part of
      the country, you will have rather more attention paid you than you will
      find by any means agreeable. So now take yourself off while you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he removed his foot from the scoundrels breast, and with
      difficulty restraining an impulse to bestow upon him a parting kick,
      allowed him to rise and slink doggedly away. And now the Rosebud, who,
      between alarm, and gratitude, and shyness, and an embarrassing
      consciousness that their champion was young and handsome, was altogether
      in a great state of agitation and excitement, felt it incumbent upon her,
      as spokeswoman, to express her sentiments as best she might. Accordingly,
      with some hesitation and many blushes, which unfortunately the increasing
      darkness rendered invisible, she informed the stranger how very much
      obliged to him they were: and impressed upon his mind the state of abject
      terror from which he had relieved them, glancing slightly at the anxiety
      they felt for the favourable termination of the combat, and their
      admiration of, and gratitude for, his heroic conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger received her acknowledgments with a quiet smile, partly
      pleased, partly amused by the young girl&rsquo;s eagerness; then, in a few
      simple, courteous, well-chosen words, he expressed the pleasure he had
      felt in having been able to render them such a slight service; adding, he
      should always consider it a most fortunate occurrence that, owing to a
      fancy which had seized him, to find his way from the railroad-station
      across the fields, he had been enabled to arrive just at the most critical
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rosebud listened to him attentively. One thing was quite evident, be
      he whom he might, both his language and manner proved him a gentleman.
      Mysterious and deeply interesting! Could it be Prince Albert, wandering
      about the country in disguise, for some inexplicable purpose connected
      with political economy, or the Admirable Crichton, suddenly &ldquo;come alive,&rdquo;
       to seek for a wife in the nineteenth century?
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of the &ldquo;Ph<i>ee-a</i>ton,&rdquo; which had been taken poorly, and
      obliged to have its wheel oiled,&mdash;a process which, owing to the
      inefficiency of the blacksmith who (<i>faute de mieux</i>) had been called
      in to attend the patient, had occupied a longer portion of time than was
      by any means necessary,&mdash;interrupted Emily&rsquo;s conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious stranger, as soon as he understood the connection between
      the vehicle and the damsels he had rescued, politely handed them in; and,
      refusing Caroline&rsquo;s timid offer of a seat, again raised his hat, and the
      carriage driving on, was soon lost to sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Emily, what a brave, handsome, courteous, interesting creature!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Caroline, enthusiastically; &ldquo;who can he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t conceive; but we shall be sure to find out, for he is walking in
      the direction of Ashburn,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He certainly knocked that
      dreadful man down very cleverly, and was extremely kind and good-natured
      to us; but do you think him so very handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there can&rsquo;t be a doubt about it! Those pale, interesting features&mdash;that
      lofty brow&mdash;those splendid flashing eyes&mdash;the dark clusters of
      his waving hair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry, you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the man at first sight, and are a
      susceptible little goose; he is by no means the Adonis you make out; and,
      remember, we know nothing about him; he may be a bagman for anything we
      can tell to the contrary,&rdquo; rejoined Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite certain he is a gentleman, and most likely something better
      still. He spoke just like Lord Adolphus Fitztoplofty, when I danced with
      him at the race-ball, and he asked me whether I&rsquo;d seen the &lsquo;ProphÃ¨te,&rsquo; and
      if I didn&rsquo;t doat upon that dear Mario (so lucky that he should fix upon
      the only opera I&rsquo;d ever heard, wasn&rsquo;t it?), and yet you pretend to believe
      he&rsquo;s a bagman; but I know you only say so to plague me, you naughty
      thing;&rdquo; and thus speaking, Caroline relieved her overwrought feelings by
      giving her friend a playful blow, which the most fragile fly might have
      endured unshrinkingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I never hinted anything of the kind,&rdquo; returned Emily; &ldquo;<i>au
      contraire</i>, I believe Lord Adolphus to be a thoroughly
      well-authenticated young nobleman, and consider him the most gentlemanly
      puppy I have ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiresome girl; you know I don&rsquo;t mean Lord Fitz. But I&rsquo;ll stake my
      penetration on the stranger&rsquo;s gentility; you only abuse him because you
      admire him so much that you are ashamed to own it, you mean, deceitful
      girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly child, how can you be so absurd!&rdquo; said the Rosebud; but although it
      was so dark that, if she <i>had</i> blushed, her friend could never have
      discovered it, she turned away her head as she spoke.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;SHUFFLING, DEALING, AND TURNING UP A KNAVE AND A TRUMP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;T</span>ake this to Sir
      Thomas Crawley, and tell him I am waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant to whom the above direction was given, carried the card to
      which it referred to his master, who, lifting it from the silver waiter on
      which it was presented, read the following name&mdash;&ldquo;The Rev. Ernest
      Carrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the gentleman into the library, and bring candles there directly,&rdquo;
       said Sir Thomas; then, thrusting his fingers through the short, stiff,
      grey bristles, suggestive of a venerable and well-worn scrubbing-brush,
      which constituted his head of hair&mdash;an action which, to any one
      acquainted with his habits, would have proved that he was anxious and
      excited&mdash;he turned, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the library, his excitement seemed to have increased and
      taken a crabbed turn, for it was in no very cordial tone of voice that he
      addressed his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, as I presume, you have come here in consequence of my letter, I must
      say you have chosen a somewhat late hour for a business visit, young
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost no time, sir, in making the necessary inquiries,&rdquo; was the reply.
      &ldquo;Immediately on receiving your letter I hastened to London, saw your
      solicitor, perused my grandfather&rsquo;s will, obtained the information I
      required, and came down by the first train that stopped at the Flatville
      station; and, as your man of business informed me time was of importance,
      I would not wait till to-morrow, lest the delay might cause you
      inconvenience. If that is not sufficient apology for my untimely visit, I
      have none other to offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The calm, respectful, but at the same time perfectly self-possessed manner
      of the speaker, appeared to have the same land of effect upon his auditor
      that the keeper&rsquo;s eye has upon some savage animal, for he replied, in a
      more civil tone than he had yet used,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, well&mdash;I see&mdash;yes. I am obliged to you for the prompt
      attention you have paid to my letter.&rdquo; He paused, then added, with
      affected indifference,&mdash;&ldquo;About the entail; you find, of course, that
      the point raised was a wholly unnecessary one, and that your signature is
      a mere matter of form, to satisfy the absurd scruples of the party
      negotiating for the purchase; some people are so ridiculously cautious,
      ha! ha!&rdquo; and here he laughed a forced, uneasy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was by no means the view the solicitor whom I consulted in town
      appeared to take of the matter,&rdquo; was Ernest&rsquo;s quiet reply. &ldquo;So far from
      it, that he declared, without my signature, the title was worthless; and
      that, if I were inclined to litigate the question, he had not a doubt that
      I should gain my cause. The estates, he said, were clearly entailed; and,
      therefore, my grandfather could not alienate them without my father&rsquo;s
      consent, which, I need scarcely tell you, he never attempted to obtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Crawley&rsquo;s brow grew black as midnight. &ldquo;Preposterous,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;quite childish and preposterous. I have taken counsel&rsquo;s opinion on the
      point, and they say you haven&rsquo;t a leg to stand on. You must have consulted
      some very ignorant person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it is Mr. S., of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Street,&rdquo;
       replied Ernest, naming a gentleman whose reputation for legal knowledge
      and acumen was undeniable; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it matters little, for I
      have no intention of raising the question. The <i>animus</i> of my
      grandfather&rsquo;s will is unmistakable; he meant to leave every acre away from
      my father; and I should scorn to hold the estate on no better tenure than
      the juggling of a legal-quibble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are prepared to sign the paper resigning all claim upon the
      entailed estates, are you?&rdquo; inquired Sir Thomas, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this very moment, if you choose,&rdquo; was the ready answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas paused an instant in thought ere he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such extreme hurry: Mr. Selby, my country agent, will be here
      to-morrow morning, and can witness your signature. I am glad to find that
      you take such a sensible view of the matter. I feared you might have
      formed some rash hopes on the strength of my application; in fact, I was
      most unwilling to apply to you; but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it impossible to make out a title which could sell the estate
      without so doing,&rdquo; interposed Ernest in a tone of quiet politeness, in
      which it would have required perceptions quicker and more delicate than
      those of Sir Thomas Crawley to have distinguished the covert satire that
      lurked beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly: one of those contemptible legal quibbles which you so justly
      reprobate,&rdquo; returned Sir Thomas; &ldquo;however, I am glad to perceive you feel
      with me so completely. You will dine with me? and I have a bed very much
      at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ernest thanked him, but civilly declined. Sir Thomas however, persisted&mdash;he
      would take no denial; and at length a compromise was effected, Ernest
      consenting to dine with his rich relative, on condition that he might
      return to the inn where he had left his valise, in time to write one or
      two letters of importance to go by the early post the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner passed off agreeably enough; Ernest being one of those happily
      endowed individuals who, without falsifying their own opinions, or seeming
      the thing they are not, yet possess the talent of adapting their
      conversation to those with whom they are thrown in company, in such a
      manner as to set them at ease, and draw out the best points of their
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas experienced the full influence of this fascination, and talked
      largely of his schemes for the amelioration of his tenantry; of plans for
      the revision and modification of the poor-laws; of the advisability of
      erecting model lodging-houses for the industrial classes, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
      until he had deceived his companion, and almost persuaded himself into the
      belief that he was an enlightened philanthropist, overflowing with the
      milk of human kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to the inn at Ashburn, Ernest wrote the following letter to
      an old college friend, who was junior partner in the office of the legal
      luminary to whom he had alluded in his interview with Sir Thomas Crawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Milford,&mdash;Since I saw you two days ago, I have got through a
      considerable amount of business, met with an adventure, and, in short,
      condensed more active existence into the last eight-and-forty hours than
      one often accomplishes in as many days. One thing I am delighted to tell
      you,&mdash;I have succeeded in procuring employment, which will more than
      provide for the few requirements without which one must degrade from the
      rank of a gentleman. You can now, therefore, carry out the arrangement I
      explained to you, and settle the small residue of my poor father&rsquo;s
      property upon my sisters;&mdash;my mother, as you are aware, having (I
      own, against my wishes) married again. Thanks to those unnaturally amiable
      railroad shares which my father bought just before his decease, and which
      have turned out a really good investment (I look upon any one who, having
      gambled in railroads, leaves off a winner, as I should at a rat, who,
      nibbling at a baited trap, carried off the cheese scatheless), they will
      thus be able to live in comparative comfort, especially on the Continent,
      which their tastes lead them to prefer. The employment I have obtained is
      not exactly to my liking, but I shall look out for a curacy if I find the
      duties of my position unbearably irksome. Owing to my wrangler&rsquo;s degree I
      distanced some half-dozen competitors, and obtained the post of classical
      and mathematical master at Doctor Donkiestir&rsquo;s well-known school, almost
      as soon as I had entered my name as candidate. I begin my new duties the
      day after to-morrow, at which time the school meets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having been thus enabled to place my sisters beyond the reach of poverty,
      my last scruple, in regard to that which you are pleased to call my absurd
      Quixotism, about the entailed estates, has vanished; and I, this evening,
      signified <i>in proprid persona</i> to Sir Thomas, my willingness to &lsquo;do a
      little bit of Esau,&rsquo; as you irreverently term signing away my birthright&mdash;and
      here, <i>par parenthÃ¨se</i>, let me observe that you are too much addicted
      to this style of scriptural jesting&mdash;a fault the more to be
      reprehended because (as I find to my cost) it is decidedly infectious: <i>verbum
      sat!</i> The aforesaid &lsquo;Sir Thomas&rsquo; seems, as far as one can judge on so
      short an acquaintance, by no means so black as he is painted; indeed, upon
      many of the great social questions of the day, his ideas coincide
      wonderfully with my own: he was polite in the extreme, though I must
      confess his amiability <i>followed</i> my declaration that I was willing
      to meet his wishes in regard to the entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This epistle has run to such an unexpected length, that I have no room to
      detail my adventure, and will merely stimulate your curiosity by adding
      that it was intensely romantic, and that it contained the elements of the
      two things which, in the old Trinity days, we esteemed the greatest
      pleasures in life&mdash;viz., a fight and a flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consideration of my cloth, I indulged, in the first sparingly, and
      abstained from the last entirely; though, as far as the twilight enabled
      me to judge, the provocation was a very fair one. I know the epithet this
      confession will obtain for me; but I had rather bear the ignominy of being
      considered a &lsquo;muff,&rsquo; than merit the designation of a &lsquo;fast parson;&rsquo; and so
      fare thee well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ernest Carrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Remember, my sisters are not to know that I am sacrificing
      anything to add to their income; you are merely to inform them that, my
      father&rsquo;s affairs being at length arranged, they will for the future be in
      the receipt of six hundred and fifty pounds per annum, instead of the four
      hundred which you before paid to them; and the delightful mist through
      which all women regard business matters, will effectually prevent their
      making any further discoveries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having sealed his letter, Ernest betook himself to bed, and fell asleep as
      contentedly as if he had not sacrificed an estate worth Â£10,000 to a
      chivalrous scruple, and a patrimony of Â£200 a-year to brotherly affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Crawley might consider him a weak-minded, good-natured fool;
      Milford designate him a &ldquo;muff.&rdquo; But if there were a few mere such muffs
      and fools in this realm of good King Mammon, that same kingdom might be
      better worth living in.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning he was again at Ashburn Priory; signed the
      deed relinquishing all claim upon the entailed estates; shook hands
      cordially with the rich man who was thus scheming to defraud him; and
      started with a light heart, and still lighter purse, to carry his own
      carpet-bag seven miles to the railroad. About a mile from the station, a
      pony-chaise overtook him, driven by a stout serving-lad, and containing
      two gentlemanly-looking boys, dressed in mourning, and a ponderous trunk,
      carefully corded and directed. As this vehicle approached, Ernest, who had
      walked fast, paused to wipe his brow, at the same time resting his
      carpet-bag&mdash;which he had carried on a stick over his shoulder&mdash;upon
      the top of the last milestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder of the two boys regarded him attentively; then whispered
      something to the younger, who nodded and smiled in reply; making a sign to
      the driver to stop, the elder boy, addressing Ernest, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but you seem tired: we are going to the Flatville
      station, and have a vacant seat at your service, if you please to accept
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will with the greatest pleasure,&rdquo; returned Ernest, &ldquo;if you are sure we
      shall not overweight the pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;you need not be in the least afraid of
      that, sir,&rdquo; interposed the younger boy confidently. &ldquo;Samson can draw us;
      Samson is as strong as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Israelitish namesake, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Ernest, placing his
      carpet-bag on the top of the trunk, and springing lightly into the
      pony-chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> was going to say, as strong as the Elephant and Castle,&rdquo;
       remarked the younger boy, with a look of profound sagacity; &ldquo;but, perhaps,
      the original Samson will do as well. What do you say, Percy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that you are an absurd little chatterbox, Hugh, and I have little
      doubt the gentleman thinks so too,&rdquo; returned his brother,&mdash;for the
      reader need scarcely read the direction on the trunk, albeit written in
      Percy&rsquo;s plainest hand, to inform him that the boys were the two young
      Colvilles, then leaving home for the first time in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting had been a trying scene for all the persons concerned; and
      poor Hugh had only just recovered from the hearty cry, in which even his
      incipient manly dignity could not preserve him from indulging, when they
      overtook Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chatterbox, perhaps, but not an absurd one,&rdquo; was the good-natured
      reply. &ldquo;I feel particularly interested about the pony, I can assure you;
      have you had him long? I daresay he is a-great favourite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, which was addressed to. Hugh, was too much for the poor
      little fellow&rsquo;s fortitude, and, after a vain struggle to repress them, his
      scarcely dried tears sprang forth anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy threw his arm around him, and drew him affectionately to his side,
      as he said, in an explanatory whisper, &ldquo;He is going to school for the
      first time, sir; and before he comes back, the pony we are so fond of must
      be sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; inquired Ernest, interested by the boy&rsquo;s manner and appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am older, and therefore better able to bear such little trials,&rdquo; was
      the reply. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Percy continued, in a lower tone, &ldquo;my mother depends
      upon me to take care of him, and keep up his spirits, for he has no father
      now to protect him.&rdquo; Ernest glanced involuntarily at their deep mourning,
      and there was a pause; for the circumstance brought vividly before his
      recollection a similar period of sorrow, when death had been busy among
      his own loved ones, and his father and a younger brother, of whom Percy
      strongly reminded him, had been called from this world of care, and sin,
      and sorrow, to that better land, &ldquo;where the wicked cease from troubling,
      and the weary are at rest.&rdquo; The silence was at length broken by Hugh,
      whose grief was a very April kind of affair, even at the worst of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are not going to school, sir, too?&rdquo; he said, addressing
      Ernest, while a merry sparkle in his eye belied the {implicit}&rsquo; the
      question indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may be,&rdquo; returned Ernest, smiling at the applicability of the
      question to his own situation. &ldquo;If I should tell you that I were going to
      do so, would you believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should,&rdquo; replied Hugh, regarding him attentively. &ldquo;People
      don&rsquo;t usually go to school when they&rsquo;ve these things on their faces;&rdquo; and,
      as he spoke, he, with a gesture half coaxing, half arch, gave a gentle
      twitch to Ernest&rsquo;s curling whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy, afraid Hugh&rsquo;s sudden rush into intimacy might annoy the stranger,
      attempted to restrain him, but Ernest, with a good-natured smile,
      prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not check him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;our friendship will not end any sooner
      because it has begun rather rapidly.&rdquo; He then, entered into conversation
      with the boys, choosing subjects in which he imagined they would feel
      interest, and enlarging upon them so cleverly and amusingly, that ere they
      reached the station, he had completely captivated the fresh, warm hearts
      of his young-companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you say if I guess where you are going to?&rdquo; he inquired of
      Hugh, as they drove up to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you guess right, I shall say you must be a conjuror,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are going to Doctor Donkiestir&rsquo;s school, at Tickletown. Am I
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, quite right,&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh, clapping his hands in delighted
      surprise; &ldquo;but you <i>must</i> be a conjuror; how did you contrive to find
      it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ernest enjoyed the mystification for a minute or so; then, casting his
      eyes on the box, observed quietly, &ldquo;I was taught to read when I was a good
      little boy; and your brother has written that direction so plainly, that I
      must have been blind if I had not been able to decipher it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you cheat! anybody could have done that,&rdquo; returned Hugh,
      contemptuously; &ldquo;and I to think you a conjuror: Why, I expected to see you
      take twenty eggs out of an empty bag, and make a boiled plum-pudding in
      your hat, like the man we-saw perform last year. I say, Percy, it strikes
      me I&rsquo;ve been making a goose of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very decidedly,&rdquo; was Percy&rsquo;s quiet reply.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;A FAST SPECIMEN OF &ldquo;YOUNG ENGLAND.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he railroad
      station at Flatville was a large and central one, two or three branches
      converging at that point and joining the main line. A train from London
      was due before that by which the Colvilles were to proceed would start.
      Almost at the moment our little party arrived it made its appearance, the
      engine snorting and puffing, as though it were about to burst with spite
      at having been forced to draw so heavy a train at the rate of fifty
      miles-an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the train by which our cousin, Wilfred Goldsmith, was to arrive;
      but it is so long since I last saw him, that I scarcely expect to
      recognise him,&rdquo; observed Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I hope we shall not miss him, for he will take care that they don&rsquo;t
      put us into a wrong carriage, and carry us off to some desolate island,
      where we shall never be heard of any more till we have been eaten by the
      savages like Captain Cook; and then you know it will be too late,&rdquo;
       suggested Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ensure you against that catastrophe,&rdquo; observed Ernest, &ldquo;even if
      your cousin should not make his appearance; for I am going as far as
      Tickletown, and we will travel in the came carriage; see, they are
      bringing them up now&mdash;follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and having committed the important trunk to the care of an
      amiable and intelligent porter, Ernest selected a carriage, and the trio
      took their seats. Just before the train was about to start, an individual
      bustled up, followed by a porter carrying a writing-desk and a railway-rug
      glowing with all the colours of the rainbow. The moment the door was
      opened, he sprang in with such energy as nearly to overturn poor Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg your pardon, little boy, but &rsquo;pon my word I didn&rsquo;t see you&mdash;you
      ought to grow a couple of sizes larger to travel safe by rail; it was
      nearly a case of infanticide&mdash;a <i>spoilt</i> child, as somebody
      calls it. That&rsquo;ll do, Velveteens&rdquo; (this was addressed to the porter);
      &ldquo;gently with that writing-desk, if you please; there&rsquo;s all my personal
      jewellery, and several Â£500 notes in it. That&rsquo;s the time of day! Sorry the
      directors set their faces against tipping; but the first occasion on which
      we meet in private life, half-a-crown awaits you; till then, Velveteens,
      as the Archbishop says in the play, &lsquo;Accept my blessing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was either a very small man, or a large boy dressed in adult
      clothing&mdash;at first sight it was not easy to determine which&mdash;till
      closer observation detected, in the breaking-voice, now hoarse, now
      shrill, the youthful complexion, and straggling, unformed figure,
      sufficient evidence that the latter hypothesis was the correct one. His
      outer boy was encased in a rough, very loose pea-jacket, with
      preternatural buttons, a. pair of the very &ldquo;loudest&rdquo; checked trousers, <i>real</i>
      Wellington boots, with heels not above three inches high, a shawl round
      his neck, in regard to which Emily&rsquo;s perfidious shopman might have been
      believed, had he declared the colours to be indisputably <i>fast</i>;
      while a velvet travelling-cap, with a bullion tassel, completed his
      costume. Having wrapped his rug round his lower limbs, and gone through a
      most elaborate pantomime of making himself comfortable, he condescended to
      favour his companions with a glance of patronising scrutiny; apparently
      satisfying himself, by this means, that they were sufficiently respectable
      to be honoured by his conversation, he turned to Ernest, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine open weather this, sir&mdash;jolly for the hunting&mdash;none-of
      your confounded frosts to-day&mdash;regular break up yesterday evening,
      and been thawing like bricks ever since&mdash;fond of hunting, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider it a fine, manly sport, but too dangerous for little boys to
      be allowed to indulge in,&rdquo; returned Ernest, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either not detecting, or more probably purposely ignoring, the covert
      satire of his speech, the fast young gentleman appeared to agree in the
      sentiment. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for instance, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise this
      small shaver&rdquo; (indicating with a motion of the eyelid Hugh, who sat
      watching him with breathless astonishment) &ldquo;to trust himself across
      country outside a horse; but when one has come to&mdash;ahem! years of
      discretion, and learned how to take care of oneself,&mdash;the purpose for
      which divines tell us we are sent into the world,&mdash;why the more
      hunting one gets the jollier, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been out hunting yourself, may I ask?&rdquo; inquired Ernest,
      fixing his penetrating glance full on the boy&rsquo;s countenance; who, despite
      his fastness, was not, when asked a straightforward question, prepared to
      tell an actual lie, though to adhere to the exact truth would have made
      his previous remarks appear singularly inconsistent and uncalled for;
      accordingly he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ar&mdash;well&mdash;yes&mdash;oh! of course I&rsquo;ve been out hunting&mdash;ah&mdash;not
      exactly on horseback, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s just the same thing, you know;&mdash;what
      a shocking slow train this is, to be sure!&mdash;&mdash;they hardly do
      their five-and-thirty miles an hour; I shall certainly write to the <i>Times</i>
      about it, if they don&rsquo;t mind what they&rsquo;re at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech Hugh&rsquo;s sharp eyes had deciphered the direction on the
      important writing-desk, containing the jewellery and the incalculable
      number of Â£500 notes, and he promulgated the result of his discovery thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wilfred J. Goldsmith, Esquire:&rsquo; what! are <i>you</i> our cousin Wilfred?
      why I took you for a gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Percy, scandalised at his brother&rsquo;s rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; continued Hugh quickly, while-Ernest turned away
      his head to hide an irrepressible smile; &ldquo;I mean, I took you for a grown
      up gentleman, and not a boy like Percy, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This involuntary tribute to the man-about-town-like adultness-of his
      manners and appearance delighted Wilfred Jacob more than the most
      elaborate compliment courtier could have devised; at length he had found
      some one to believe in him, and to take him at his own valuation, and he
      adopted and steadily patronised Hugh from that time forth. He was much too
      wide awake, however, to allow this to appear; replying in the off-hand;
      manner which he affected&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather an equivocal compliment that, young&rsquo;un; but I expect it was
      better meant than expressed: so I&rsquo;ll take the will for the deed, as the
      lawyer&rsquo;s clerk did after he&rsquo;d mixed the &lsquo;dog&rsquo;s-nose&rsquo; rather too still at
      his early dinner. &lsquo;Always give credit for good intentions,&rsquo; is a copy old
      Splitnib (so called from an analogy between his professional avocations,
      and the fact of his having, in by-gone hours, fallen over a form, and
      divided the bridge of his own proboscis) will set you writing before you
      are many days older; and in me you behold a living embodiment of the
      precept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it we did not see you at the station, Cousin: Wilfred?&rdquo; inquired
      Percy; &ldquo;we waited as long as we dared, till we thought we should lose the
      train looking for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, my dear boy,&rdquo; began Wilfred, stretching out a boot beyond
      the rainbow-coloured wrapper, for the purpose of tapping it admiringly
      with a dandyfied little cane, &ldquo;leaving the modern Babylon by the seven
      o&rsquo;clock a.m., I necessarily breakfasted early; and as, according to
      Cocker, the interval between six a.m. and one p.m. embraces seven hours, I
      experienced, on my arrival at the Flatville station, the very
      uncomfortable sensation of nature abhorring a vacuum in my breadbasket;
      and, as even Curtius himself could scarcely have contrived to fill up a
      similar gulf by jumping down his own throat, I walked first into the
      refreshment-room, and then into a basin of mock-turtle soup. A deucedly
      pretty gal it was who handed it to me, too; uncommon attentive she was, to
      be sure: in fact, <i>entre nous</i>,&rdquo; he continued, leaning confidently
      towards Ernest, &ldquo;it strikes me she wasn&rsquo;t altogether insensible to the
      personal attractions of &lsquo;yours truly&rsquo;&mdash;do you twig?&rdquo; Ernest smiled as
      he replied, &ldquo;Of course she charged for the admiration as well as for your
      luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real turtle as well as mock, eh? I hope you don&rsquo;t mean any insinuation
      about a calf&rsquo;s head too I But, now you mention it, I <i>do</i> think
      seven-and-sixpence was rather high for a basin of soup. Ah! the women,
      they make sad fools of us youth; but as the old lady piously remarked,
      when her pet dog died of repletion, &lsquo;Such is life, which is the end of all
      things:&rsquo;&mdash;heigh-ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having relieved his feelings by venting a deep sigh, Master (he would have
      annihilated us for so calling him) Wilfred Jacob, who appeared gifted with
      an interminable flow of conversation, and an insatiable delight in
      listening to his own voice, again addressed his companions, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, gentlemen: the cares of existence, and the
      heartlessness of that deluding mock-turtle soup gal, ar weighing upon my
      spirits to such a degree, that nothing short of a mild cigar can bring me
      round again: that is, always supposing you, none of you, entertain a <i>rooted</i>
      aversion (you perceive the pun?) to the leaves of the Indian herb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you are aware that smoking in a first-class carriage is against
      the rules of the railway company,&rdquo; suggested Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that some such prejudice exists in their feeble minds,&rdquo; was the
      rejoinder; &ldquo;but they are not obliged to learn anything about it, are they?
      &lsquo;Where ignorance is bliss,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first porter who opens the door is certain to perceive the smell; and
      of course, if he inquires whence it proceeds, I shall not attempt to
      disguise the truth,&rdquo; returned Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;even if such an alarming contingency were to
      accrue, I know a safe dodge to throw him off the scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I possessed any authority over you, I should strongly remonstrate
      against your violating such a wise and useful regulation,&rdquo; observed
      Ernest, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fearful moral responsibility not resting upon your conscience&mdash;for
      which, as a philanthropist, I feel humbly thankful&mdash;I shall, with
      your leave, waste no more precious time, but go ahead at once.&rdquo; So saying
      the young pickle drew from his pocket a small neatly finished leather
      ease, well filled with cigars; having politely offered it in turn to each
      of his companions, who were unanimous in their refusal, he selected a
      cigar, lighted it by means of a piece of German tinder, and, placing it in
      his mouth, began puffing away with equal zest and science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set it going to his satisfaction, he removed it for a moment, and,
      emitting a graceful wreath of smoke, resumed&mdash;&ldquo;Capital good cigars
      these&mdash;came from Fribourg and Pontet&rsquo;s&mdash;I never smoke any others&mdash;better
      change your mind and take one, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, &lsquo;pon my word your
      name has escaped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite certain you ever knew it?&rdquo; inquired Ernest, whilst a smile
      of quiet intelligence curled his handsome mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no degree disconcerted, Master Wilfred took another long pull at his
      cigar ere he replied, &ldquo;Not to be done, eh, sir? Well, I respect a man all
      the more for being unpumpable; dodginess, in all its branches, is the
      virtue I most venerate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what <i>is</i> dodginess, please, Cousin Wilfred?&rdquo; inquired Hugh,
      upon whose youthful intelligence slang was, for the first time, dawning
      with all its fascinating eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dodginess, my verdant young relative, is a psychological attribute
      compounded of equal portions of presence of mind and fertility of
      resource, which enables every &lsquo;cove&rsquo; (cove is a generic appellation for
      indiscriminate male humanity) thus happily endowed, to rise superior to
      all the minor obstacles of existence; as, for example, when I, trying to
      pump the gentleman opposite in regard to his patronymic, was by him foiled
      in my attempt, and convicted of the logical absurdity of having declared
      myself to have forgotten that which I had never known; or, again,&mdash;when,
      this morning, my governor, your venerable uncle, who, benighted innocent
      that he is, hopes to coerce me into giving up smoking, took from me my
      cigar-case, but allowed me to regain it by picking his pocket thereof,
      while squabbling with the cabman for an extra sixpence;&mdash;mind you
      recollect all this; for, in these days slag is completely the language of
      fashionable life. Were I that epitome of slowness, &lsquo;the father of a
      family,&rsquo; I should have the young idea taught to clothe itself in slang
      from the cradle upwards. And now, as I&rsquo;ve a notion the train is
      approaching a station, and my cigar has arrived at its terminus, you shall
      witness a specimen of dodginess with your own eyes;&mdash;be silent, and
      observe me attentively&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then flung the end of his cigar out of window, and, assuming an air of
      great consequence, waited till the train stopped; the moment he did so, he
      summoned a porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porter, open the door!&rdquo; The man obeyed. &ldquo;Put your head in and tell me
      what this carriage smells of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter, looking surprised at the request, complied&mdash;&ldquo;It smells
      tobaccer-efied like to me,&rdquo; he observed, after a minute&rsquo;s investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobaccer-efied, indeed!&rdquo; repeated Wilfred Jacob, in a tone of the deepest
      indignation; &ldquo;some brute has been smoking in this carriage, I&rsquo;m certain of
      it! a first-class carriage, too. I tell you what, porter, when gentlemen
      pay for the comfort and convenience of a first-class carriage, they expect
      to enjoy what they pay for, and not to be poisoned alive with the odour of
      tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoking ain&rsquo;t never allowed in the fust class, sir,&rdquo; pleaded the
      embarrassed porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be allowed, but <i>it has been done</i>,&rdquo; was the captious
      reply: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath some one has been smoking in this carriage; I&rsquo;m
      as certain of it as if I&rsquo;d seen them myself; my nose never deceives me;&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name be Johnson; but I&rsquo;ll call the station-master to speak to you,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means; it&rsquo;s no fault of his,&rdquo; replied Wilfred, hastily, feeling
      anything but desirous that a more enlightened intellect should be brought
      to bear upon the question: &ldquo;no, I shall write to the directors, to
      complain, and call you to witness that I mentioned the fact at the first
      station we stopped at. It&rsquo;s absurd to pretend to make rules, and then
      suffer them to be broken in this way. Shut the door. I shall remember your
      name&mdash;Johnson!&rdquo; and as he uttered the last word, the train started.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions exchanged glances: Percy&rsquo;s expressed disapproval; Hugh&rsquo;s,
      mingled surprise and delight; while Ernest was so much amused at the boy&rsquo;s
      ready wit and cool impudence, that, for the life of him, he could not
      reprove him for the deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the recollection of this little incident had, in some degree, worn
      off, Percy asked his cousin how he liked Doctor Donkiestir&rsquo;s school; and
      begged him to tell them a little about the manners and customs of the
      place to which they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put you up to a thing or two, eh? Give you some small insight into the
      time of day? Well, I suppose, as it&rsquo;s all in the family, and you&rsquo;re
      Tickletonians yourselves, or about to become so, it&rsquo;s no breach of
      confidence. <i>You</i> won&rsquo;t split, sir?&rdquo; he continued, appealingly, to
      Ernest. &ldquo;Honour amongst thieves, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust me,&rdquo; was the concise reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First promise me, upon your honour, that you will not tell any of the
      masters, then,&rdquo; stipulated Wilfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour I will not tell any of them,&rdquo; was the slightly Jesuitical
      reply; &ldquo;nor will I make an unfair use of any information you may please to
      communicate to my young friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then. You look like a brick (I&rsquo;m a bit of a
      physiognomist, you see), so I&rsquo;ll trust you. In the first place, masters:
      there&rsquo;s the Doctor, <i>alias</i> old Donkey, <i>alias</i> (his name is
      John) Jackass, with sundry other derivatives, more caustic than
      complimentary. Well, he&rsquo;s not altogether a bad sort of fellow, only he
      makes a fuss about trifles, and is especially jealous if he fancies that
      any one appears likely to interfere with what he calls his prerogative; in
      fact, he would be a stunner if his temper did not stand in his way: but,
      on the whole the boys like him, and so look over his little failings.
      Then, there&rsquo;s a sort of second master, &lsquo;Mat. and Clat.&rsquo; we call him, which
      is short for mathematical and classical; but we are changing horses in
      that quarter, so, till we have tried the new animal (pretty well tried he
      will be, too, before we&rsquo;ve done with him, I expect), it&rsquo;s impossible to
      say how he may suit us; only, if he ain&rsquo;t a tolerably wide-awake cove, I
      pity him; for, between master and boys, he&rsquo;ll have a sweet time of it,
      poor devil! Then there are two ushers&mdash;Hexameter and Pentameter
      (familiarly Hex. and Pen.) so termed because one is six feet high and the
      other scarcely above five: they are not gentlemen, therefore they don&rsquo;t
      act as <i>sich</i>, so of course we &lsquo;chouse&rsquo; and bully them as much as we
      dare. Then there&rsquo;s old Splitnib, a coach of the most unmitigated slowness,
      but who writes a wonderful hand; and, finally and lastly, Monsieur
      Beaugentil, the French master, who is more involuntarily comic than all
      the rest of his frog-devouring nation put together. These worthies rule,
      and are ruled by, a floating capital of some two hundred boys, more or
      less, of whom the eldest may be about seventeen or eighteen, and the
      youngest on a par with this juvenile shaver here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you work very hard?&rdquo; inquired Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not we,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Of course, for decency&rsquo;s sake, we do something.
      It don&rsquo;t pay for a fellow to be quite an ignoramus in these days, unless
      he happens to have been born a lord, or experienced some such jolly
      dispensation at starting; but as for hard work,&mdash;no, thank ye. What&rsquo;s
      the use of having a fag, if you can&rsquo;t get your exercises done for you, I
      should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a fag?&rdquo; inquired Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first effect of this apparently simple question was to throw the
      person to whom it was addressed into a state of the most violent laughter.
      As soon as he could recover breath, he gasped out, &ldquo;Oh, lor! it&rsquo;s very
      fatiguing; you&rsquo;ll be the death of me with your blessed innocence, that you
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a less severe relapse, he continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon know what fagging
      means, you poor, unfortunate, green little warmint; though I think I shall
      honour you by taking you myself. I&rsquo;ve a right to a fag now I&rsquo;m in the
      fifth form; and the chap I had last half has left. You seem a jolly,
      good-tempered little beggar, and I shouldn&rsquo;t like to see you made
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall never be ill-used while I am alive,&rdquo; exclaimed Percy, with
      flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very proper and plucky sentiment on your part, my dear boy,&rdquo;
       returned Wilfred; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a precious deal easier to talk about than to
      act upon. You can&rsquo;t thrash a whole school, especially when some of them
      are almost men grown. Such chaps as Biggington or Thwackings, who can
      polish off a coalheaver sporting style, for instance; your namesake
      Hotspur himself would have found such fellows as them tough customers. All
      you can do with them is to keep &rsquo;em in good humour while you can,
      and get out of their way when you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this time you have not told me what a fag is,&rdquo; interrupted Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a fag is a small boy, taken possession of by a larger boy,
      according to an old established precedent, against which the masters set
      their faces in vain. The small boy thus enslaved is termed a fag, and his
      duties are to do everything the larger boy finds it impossible or
      disagreeable to do himself. If the small boy performs these duties
      zealously and good-humouredly, he is only kicked and driven about like a
      dog, and survives to become a fifth, and eventually a sixth form boy, and
      takes his change out of fags of his own. If he sulks, or neglects orders,
      he is either half or three-quarters murdered, according to the hands he
      falls into, and is usually taken away from the school, or otherwise
      expended, before he reaches hobble-de-hoy&rsquo;s estate. And now, have I made
      that clear to your juvenile capacity?&mdash;Yes?&mdash;Then mind you
      profit by it, or I shall have to show you practically how Tickletonians
      tickle,&rdquo; and as he spoke, he pointed suggestively to his cane, though a
      good-natured twinkle in his eye contradicted the threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus broken ground, he favoured the company with a series of
      dissolving views, illustrating various episodes of Tickletonian life,
      wherein were vividly portrayed scrapes got into and out of with much
      ability, and more impudence, by certain scholastic heroes, past and
      present; but the gist of each anecdote lying in the discomfiture or
      mystification of one or more of the masters, it is scarcely to be
      supposed, giving Wilfred Jacob credit for the most open disposition
      imaginable, that he would have been quite so communicative, had he divined
      the capacity in which Ernest Carrington was then journeying to Tickletown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the station at which they were to alight, an omnibus,
      provided by Doctor Donkiestir, was in waiting to convey any of his
      scholars who might arrive by that train. Ernest, who was not to present
      himself till the following morning, and had availed himself of the
      opportunity to accept the invitation of an old college friend, from whom
      he had originally heard of the vacancy, here took leave of his young
      companions, saying, as he did so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye. As I should not much wonder if we were to meet again sooner
      than you at all expect, I wish you to remember, that if at any time you
      require advice or assistance you will find a friend in Ernest Carrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then touched Wilfred&rsquo;s arm, and drawing him aside, observed,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have allowed you to run on in a way which I am sure you would have
      endeavoured to avoid had you known who I was. I did so, not from any mean
      wish to entrap you into confessions of which I might afterwards make use
      to your disadvantage, but simply in order to gain some insight into your
      true character; and now I will make a compact with you: as long as you
      behave kindly towards your two cousins, who interest me exceedingly, and
      befriend them as your superior knowledge of the world&rdquo; (the slightly
      ironical emphasis with which he pronounced the last few words was not lost
      upon his auditor, who, for once in his life, felt conscious that he had
      made-himself ridiculous), &ldquo;and especially of the little world comprised in
      a boys&rsquo; school, will enable you to do, I shall forget anything peculiar I
      may have heard this morning. I will only add, that I have misjudged your
      character if you consider the condition I have proposed a hard one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I attempt to make a suitable reply to your mysterious and
      startling communication, allow me, sir, to inquire, in the most respectful
      manner possible, first, <i>who</i> you are? secondly, <i>what</i> you
      are?&rdquo; returned Wilfred-Jacob, in a quieter tone than he had yet made use
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rev. Ernest Carrington, classical and mathematical master (or,
      familiarly, Clat. and Mat.) in Dr. Donkiestir&rsquo;s school at Tickletown, at
      your service,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first effect of this announcement was to elicit from the &ldquo;fast young
      gentleman&rdquo; a prolonged and expressive whistle; next came an aside, &ldquo;Well,
      if I haven&rsquo;t gone and put my foot into it deepish <i>rather</i>, it&rsquo;s a
      pity.&rdquo; Then, turning to Ernest, he asked, abruptly,&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon
      your honour as a gentleman, Mr. Carrington, if I stick to the young
      Colvilles like a trump, you won&rsquo;t peach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour,&rdquo; was the frank reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain, then,&rdquo; rejoined Wilfred. &ldquo;And now, sir, before we sink
      the amenities of social life in the less jovial relationship of master and
      pupil, allow me the honour of shaking hands with you, while at the same
      time you must permit me to express my opinion, that your conduct has been
      brickish in the extreme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a smile called forth by the peculiar school-boy phraseology, and
      strange admixture of good feeling and never-failing impudence, of his new
      ally, Ernest shook hands with him good-naturedly, and turned to depart;
      but Wilfred Jacob detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One slight additional favour would oblige,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A discreet silence
      in regard to the cigar episode would be a desirable addenda to our
      compact. Our friend Donkiestir has prejudices&mdash;<i>verbum sat</i>&mdash;a
      nod is as good as a wink. Farewell we meet again at Philippi.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he bowed low, removing a very shining new hat, wherewith he had
      replaced the gorgeous travelling cap, and hurried after his cousins, who
      were by this time seated in, and sole tenants of, the omnibus, where they
      presented, so to speak, a very forlorn and cast-away appearance.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;THE CONSPIRACY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;O</span>h, Percy, have
      you heard the news?&rdquo; inquired Hugh, eagerly, some five weeks after his
      arrival at Tickletown; and as he spoke, he began dancing and clinging
      round his brother in a state of the greatest excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Hugh?&rdquo; returned Percy, who, seated at his desk, was writing
      with the greatest assiduity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; resumed Hugh. &ldquo;Well, you know that a company
      of actors are performing at the Tickletown Theatre, and that all the boys
      are mad to go and see them; and no wonder, either, for, from what Wilfred
      and others, who have seen one in London, say, a play must be the most
      wonderful, glorious, jolliest, brickish-est thing going.&rdquo; Hugh was making
      surprising advances in slang, under his cousin Wilfred&rsquo;s able tuition; his
      progress in dear Dr. Valpy&rsquo;s Latin Delectus was by no means equally rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you have told me; but I know, also, that the Doctor has
      expressly forbidden any of the boys, even of the sixth form, to go to the
      theatre, on pain of expulsion. His reason&mdash;and it seems to me a good
      one&mdash;being, that he cannot exercise any surveillance (that means
      care, or watchfulness) over them, if they are allowed to be out late at
      night,&rdquo; returned Percy, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you don&rsquo;t know that the manager has written to the Doctor to say
      that he will give a morning performance, and select only pieces of which
      the Doctor shall approve, if he will allow the boys to go; and the dear,
      good, jolly old Doctor has said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and granted a half holiday next
      Thursday for the purpose; and I&rsquo;ll never call him old Donkey any more, if
      Biggington kills me for refusing. But Percy, dear Percy, do you think
      there is any chance that we could go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, although at first sight this question would appear a very simple one,
      it was by no means so easy to answer as might be imagined. In the first
      place, Percy had a vague and indistinct notion that his mother disapproved
      of theatrical entertainments; certainly, as far as his own personal
      feelings were concerned, the recent loss he had sustained, with all its
      painful consequences, rendered him indisposed to enjoy any such
      amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, on the score of expense: their pocket-money was very limited,
      Hugh being allowed sixpence, Percy a shilling a week,&mdash;a sum which
      was barely sufficient to supply slate-pencils, ink, peg-tops,
      clasp-knives, &ldquo;toffy,&rdquo; and all the other innumerable and incomprehensible
      <i>sine quÃ¢ nons</i> of a public school-boy&rsquo;s existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he had suffered both obloquy and inconvenience on account of the
      paucity of his funds, Percy had resolved that, during their first quarter,
      nothing should induce him to apply to their mother for more; and, when
      Percy had resolved upon a thing, because he considered it a matter of
      principle, Hugh was aware that Gibraltar itself was not more immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, with rather a blank expression of countenance that he
      replied to his brother&rsquo;s inquiry of what it would cost,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The admission is to be half-a-crown each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we cannot go,&rdquo; returned Percy; &ldquo;for I have not been able to save any
      of my allowance, neither do I imagine have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One reason why Percy found a difficulty in saving was, that Hugh was for
      ever losing things which must be replaced, or breaking things which
      required mending, or earnestly desirous of something or other which Percy
      could not bear to see him wishing for in vain;&mdash;for be it known, that
      unless some matter of deep feeling, or right principle, were concerned,
      his elder brother spoiled Hugh as thoroughly and unconsciously as anybody.
      Thus, in point of fact, Master Hugh spent, in addition to his own
      sixpence, some ninepence out of every shilling of Percy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hugh&rsquo;s selfishness was a fault of which he was himself perfectly
      unaware. Not being of what minor treatises on Christian ethics consider it
      the thing to term &ldquo;an introspective habit of mind,&rdquo; and knowing that if
      Percy required such a sacrifice, he would willingly allow his right hand&mdash;the
      hand with which he played marbles&mdash;to be cut off in his service; he
      was so accustomed to consider that, because he was the youngest,
      everything was to be given up to him, that he forgot the injustice of such
      an arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a halfpenny,&rdquo; was Hugh&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;that cake woman cleaned me out
      yesterday! What a goose I am to be so fond of cakes! but I like to have
      enough to give some to the other fellows too, and all we little chaps have
      a weakness for cakes;&mdash;but have <i>you</i> got no money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy shook his head. &ldquo;Breaking windows, and losing other boys&rsquo; balls, are
      expensive amusements, Hugh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember, I have got you out of
      several scrapes of that kind since we have been here. Of course, I was
      glad enough to do so; but I only mention it to account for my being nearly
      as poor as yourself. A shilling a week is soon exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh paused in deep perplexity; at last he said slowly, and in a
      hesitating voice, &ldquo;Mamma would send us the money, I think, if you would
      not mind writing to tell her that you had no objection, and that I wish to
      go so very, <i>very</i> much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should mind writing for such a purpose,&rdquo; returned Percy; &ldquo;and I
      will explain to you why: since dear papa&rsquo;s death, mamma has been very
      poor, and she is likely to be poorer still, I am afraid, for she writes me
      word that Sir Thomas Crawley still persists in his demand, and Mr.
      Wakefield is afraid she will have to pay it whenever a new clergyman is
      appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wicked! how cruel of Sir Thomas!&rdquo; interrupted Hugh, vehemently; &ldquo;and
      he is as rich as an old Jew, too;&mdash;I hate him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, Hugh, you must not speak in that way; every man has a right to
      obtain anything the law of the land will award him. But now I have told
      you this, I am sure you would not wish me to write and ask mamma to send
      us money to be spent in amusement, which she must deny herself and Emily
      the actual necessaries of life in order to procure.&rdquo; Percy waited for an
      answer with some anxiety, but, in a matter of feeling, Hugh would never
      have been likely to occasion him disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not write, for the world, Percy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I would rather never see a
      play in my life than grieve dearest mamma. Oh, Percy! I wish I were a man,
      then I&rsquo;d work hard, and keep her and Emily, and give them pleasures and
      luxuries, and make them quite happy; and as for that wicked Sir Thomas,
      I&rsquo;d punch his head for him, as Wilfred says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Hugh returned the caress his delighted brother bestowed on him,
      and walked off manfully. But his courage only lasted till he had made his
      way into an old hayloft over a large rambling stable, capable of holding
      twenty horses, but now devoted to the use of the doctor&rsquo;s fat pony, and a
      cow and a calf, also the property of that dignitary. Having reaches his
      hiding-place, his fortitude gave way, and he bewailed his disappointment
      with a hearty cry; for he was but a child after all, poor little fellow!
      and a spoiled one as well, and to such, however differently far-advanced
      Christians may appreciate the quality, self-denial appears a very harsh
      and uncomfortable virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the important day, a fresh trial awaited him; Wilfred
      Jacob, who had thoroughly fulfilled his promise to Ernest Carrington, by
      saving Hugh from ill-usage, and Percy from many of the annoyances to which
      his proud, sensitive nature rendered him peculiarly susceptible, as soon
      as breakfast was concluded, shouted vociferously for his fag&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, Hugh Colville! where has the young warment hidden himself? Oh,
      there you are; come here, you imp of darkness, I shall have to give you
      that thrashing I&rsquo;ve owed you so long, I know I shall, and when it does
      come, old Bogie have mercy on your precious bones! for I shall have none.
      Now, listen to me; the moment morning school is up, cut away like a flash
      of greased lightning, and turn out my things to dress. Let me see&mdash;I
      shall wear&mdash;hold up your head, sir, and look attentive!&mdash;I shall
      wear&mdash;ahem!&mdash;my white d&rsquo;Orsay overcoat; the light-blue coatee
      with fancy silk buttons; the pink satin under-waistcoat; the green
      embroidered vest with coral buttons; the blue necktie with crimson ends;
      the MacFerntosh plaid trousers, those with the green ground and broad red,
      and blue, and white checks over it; and the polished boots&mdash;do you
      twig? Now, then, repeat it all, that I may be sure you&rsquo;ve taken it in
      correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Orsay wrap; blue coatee; pink under, green and coral over-vests; blue
      and crimson choker; MacFerntosh sit-upons; and japanned trotter-cases,&rdquo;
       returned Hugh, gabbling over the-different items with the velocity at
      which tradition has decreed it proper to inform society that &ldquo;Peter Piper
      picked a peck of pepper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, young&rsquo;un, you improve apace; but you took to slang uncommon kindly
      from the first, I will say that for you. Well, when you&rsquo;ve looked out the
      toggery, and&mdash;ahem! brought me my shaving water;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve felt, for
      some time past, a tickling sensation at the sides of my face, which, I am
      sure, indicates the approach of whiskers. Ar&mdash;I should be rather a
      good-looking fellow if I had but got whiskers, I flatter myself; wouldn&rsquo;t
      I wear &rsquo;em bushy, that&rsquo;s all. As soon as you&rsquo;ve done all I&rsquo;ve told
      you, jump into your own juvenile habiliments, and be ready to go with me
      at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but you know, Wilfred, I&rsquo;m not to go,&rdquo; faltered poor Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to go, why not? Who says so? What! has Percy cut up rough, with his
      sanctified, Puritanical, Puseyitical, Pontifical, Hieroglyphical notions;
      oh! leave him to me, I&rsquo;ll soon talk him round;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve the highest
      possible veneration for morality and piety, and all that sort of thing,
      particularly on Sundays; but to fancy they&rsquo;ve got anything to do with
      going to the play, is an association of ideas little short of downright
      sacrilege, to my notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not that,&rdquo; returned Hugh; &ldquo;Percy would have let let me go, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; inquired Wilfred, &ldquo;come, make haste, I&rsquo;ve got thirty lines of
      Terence to knock off before I go up to Carrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only we&rsquo;ve both spent our allowance, and I&rsquo;ve not got money to pay,&rdquo;
       replied poor Hugh, fairly driven into confessing his poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled his patron, &ldquo;no assets forthcoming, eh, that&rsquo;s
      unfortunate, all the more so, because just at the present epoch my own
      financial arrangements are in a somewhat embarrassed condition&mdash;ar&mdash;banker&rsquo;s
      account over-drawn&mdash;owing to their confounded free-trade, I expect, I
      can&rsquo;t get my rents paid up,&mdash;in fact, to be frank with you, when this
      play business was first started, I, with incautious liberality,
      volunteered to make one of a jovial crew of fifth-formers, who intend to
      follow up the theatrical entertainments with a sort of extempore <i>dÃ©jeunÃ©
      Ã  la fourchette</i> of oysters and porter. Well, sir, when I came to
      examine into the state of my funds, I, after much deep and intricate
      calculation, arrived at the following result viz., that I had contracted
      liabilities to the amount of one pound five, while to meet them I
      possessed the exact sum of two shillings and threepence halfpenny&mdash;the
      halfpenny being scarcely an efficient coin of the realm, by reason of my
      having that morning punched a large hole in its centre, in pursuance of a
      mechanical experiment which failed. Under these circumstances I
      immediately wrote to the governor, saying that several unusually
      distressing cases of charity having come under my notice since I had last
      received his blessing and a ten-pound note, the blessing alone remained;
      adding that another case more urgent than any of the former now appealing
      to my sympathies, I trusted he would not object to replace the money
      without unnecessary delay. They say it is a wise child that knows its own
      father; certainly in this particular instance I seem to have formed a
      strangely mistaken estimate of the manners and customs of mine, for
      yesterday morning I received from him the following heartless reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Wilfred Jacob,&mdash;As I happen to know your charity is of the
      kind which begins and ends at home, and as two pounds a week is rather
      more than I wish you to spend on lollipops, I strongly recommend total
      abstinence from such delicacies for the next fortnight, at the expiration
      of which period you may look for a five-pound note (the last you will
      receive before the holidays), from,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your affectionate father.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my father being thus obdurate, the only alternative that remained
      for me was to apply to my uncle, in consequence of which application, my
      watch will have a little extra <i>ticking</i> to do for the next
      fortnight; &lsquo;my relation, on the security of that valuable, favouring me
      with the loan of five and twenty shillings. Thus, the admission to the
      theatre being two and sixpence, you will perceive, by a reference to
      &lsquo;Bonnycastle&rsquo;s Arithmetic,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Smith&rsquo;s Wealth of Nations,&rsquo; I am still
      two-pence-halfpenny behind the world, which sum I must beg, borrow, or
      otherwise realise before two o&rsquo;clock to-day, at which time the doors open.
      So, you see, young&rsquo;un, I literally cannot treat you, for which, without
      chaffing, I&rsquo;m really uncommon sorry; but never mind, put your trust in
      jollity, and depend upon it something to your advantage will turn up some
      day and with this well-meant, but slightly vague attempt at consolation,&rdquo;
       Wilfred Jacob passed on to have, as he termed it, a &ldquo;go in&rdquo; at Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, a solemn and important discussion was being held among
      the boys of the sixth form (some of whom were lads of seventeen and
      eighteen, and considered themselves young men), as to whether these
      morning theatricals, being got up solely with a view to the juveniles,
      were not <i>infra dig</i>. Biggington, who had grown up to fit his name,
      and stood six feet one in his stockings, and who, moreover, in virtue of
      the date of his entrance, as well as from his strength and prowess, was
      looked upon as leader of the school, decidedly set his face against it,
      and declared, with unnecessary vehemence of expression, that the play
      might be&mdash;that to which its author would have especially objected&mdash;before
      he would go to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stradwick quite agreed with him, which fact possessed every advantage but
      that of novelty; Stradwick being a mere reflection, and by be means a
      brilliant one, of Biggington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowler also considered the thing would be infernally slow, nothing
      sporting about it; besides, Jackass (alas for boy nature, that so could
      paraphrase the respectable name of Doctor John Donkiestir!) was going
      himself, and would have nothing to do but to watch them, so that if a
      fellow happened to sneeze, he would be safe to get an imposition for
      winking at an actress; for his part he&rsquo;d rather be in school at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman and Piper followed on the same side; Swann, Pitt, Kitely, Martin,
      and Jones, agreed with the foregoing, but had an original opinion of their
      own, that old Donkey was growing superannuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Warmingham, Gaston, and some dozen others, although
      considering that an exception ought to have been made in favour of the
      sixth form, thought the measure a judicious one, as far as the little
      fellows were concerned, and were, therefore, prepared to pocket their
      dignity and go;&mdash;-unless anybody had got anything better to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, Gaston, that was not a bad notion of yours about an
      exception being made in favour of the sixth; surely, if that were properly
      placed before old Jack, he could never be so besotted as to refuse,&rdquo;
       observed Fowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Fowler,&rdquo; exclaimed several voices; &ldquo;let us draw up a formal
      representation of the affair, and send up a deputation with it to Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Biggington?&rdquo; inquired Fowles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply that I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with it; I&rsquo;ll neither sign the
      address, nor head the deputation,&rdquo; was the sulky reply; &ldquo;I consider I have
      demeaned myself too much to Jack already, in submitting to his absurd
      prejudices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biggington and I view the matter exactly in the same light,&rdquo; observed
      Stradwick: &ldquo;you&rsquo;d all better give up the notion directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself, stupid!&rdquo; returned Biggington: &ldquo;if Fowler and the rest
      like to try, let them, and they&rsquo;ll see what will come of it; my own
      feelings are purely personal. Don&rsquo;t you see, fool,&rdquo; he continued, drawing
      his satellite aside, &ldquo;by the plan I adopt, they will do the dirty work,
      and, if they succeed, I shall profit by it; if they fail, I avoid the
      slight of having my request refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what shall I do?&rdquo; inquired Stradwick, who possessed just intellect
      enough to perceive that the rule of blindly following his leader would, in
      this case, annoy rather than propitiate the autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a&mdash;you see, you are&mdash;that is, we are differently&mdash;a&mdash;in
      fact, in your position I should decidedly sign the address; though&mdash;stop,
      wait a minute&mdash;on second thoughts it strikes me it may look odd to
      have every name but one on the list: Jack may think I&rsquo;ve got some dodge in
      my head, Well, never mind; if you like to follow my example you can,&rdquo;
       returned the slightly selfish Biggington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Gaston, who was famous as a scribe, wrote the address; and
      Fowler, and some half-dozen others, carried it up to the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Donkiestir, who was a tall, fine-looking man, of about fifty, with a
      clever, energetic countenance, marked, however, by the stern, worried
      expression common to schoolmasters, received the deputation courteously,
      read the address, and then observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the sixth appear to have signed this, except Biggington and
      Stradwick: why are their names absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, and then Fowler, who was naturally of an open,
      fearless disposition, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir, Biggington preferred giving up going to the theatre, to
      asking a favour which he considered it unlikely you would grant; and
      Stradwick generally does whatever Biggington does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Fowler announced this well-known fact, a general smile, which even the
      Doctor&rsquo;s presence could not entirely restrain, went the round of the
      deputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor seemed not to notice it, though a twinkle in the corner of his
      eye revealed to those who knew his every look, that he was not so
      unobservant as he appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biggington and his friend are very prudent,&rdquo; he said, with a slight
      ironical emphasis on the last word. He then paused a moment in thought ere
      he continued, &ldquo;I am very sorry that I consider it my duty to refuse your
      request, for the straightforward, gentlemanly way in which you have
      preferred it has much pleased me; but I cannot believe that I should be
      fulfilling the trust reposed in me by your parents, if I were to allow you
      to be exposed to the temptations of a theatre, in a town, at night, when
      it would be impossible for me to exercise the slightest vigilance over
      you; and this applies more strongly to the sixth form than to the younger
      boys, as many of you are almost young men, and peculiarly liable to the
      evil influences to which I allude. As some compensation I will grant a
      whole holiday, either for skating, if the weather permits, or boating, or
      cricketing, later in the season, whichever you may prefer. I hope, as a
      proof that you do not think I have been unnecessarily strict, the sixth
      will think better of it, and that I shall see many of their faces at the
      theatre this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor&rsquo;s harangue was not without its effect, for Fowler (who, though
      somewhat of a pickle, was of a warm-hearted, generous disposition) thanked
      the head master for the promised holiday, and declared his intention of
      going to the morning performance. Gaston, Warmingharn, and the rest of
      that party, followed his lead, and the deputation withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve eaten humble pie for nothing, been humbugged into promising to
      go to a childish affair you ought to be ashamed to be seen at, and been
      choused out of the only bit of fun and jollity that has come in our way
      this half. I wish you joy of your promised holiday, you good little boys,&rdquo;
       was Biggington&rsquo;s sarcastic speech, when he learned the result of their
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chaff away, Big-un&rdquo; (a familiar abbreviation of Biggington&rsquo;s patronymic,
      of which only the <i>elite</i> of the sixth were permitted to make use),
      returned Fowler, good-humouredly. &ldquo;Jacky&rsquo;s a stunning good old fellow,
      after all, and I, for one, shall go, to show him I don&rsquo;t bear malice;
      you&rsquo;d better pocket your dignity for once, Big-un, and come too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I know it, to please either old fools or young ones,&rdquo; was the
      unamiable reply; and, turning on his heel, Biggington walked angrily away,
      followed, at no great distance, by Stradwick and two or three other
      recusants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite, however, of their disapproval, the morning performance went off
      with great <i>Ã©clat</i>; and those who attended it, amongst whom were a
      large proportion of the sixth form boys, raved about their delight to such
      a degree, that even Bigging-ton, albeit he pretended to take the matter
      with a high hand, felt intensely provoked, and thrashed most unmercifully
      a small boy, who, in the innocence of his heart, incautiously promulgated
      his opinion, within the tyrant&rsquo;s hearing, that &ldquo;any one who could have
      gone and did not, must be a precious slow coach, and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the fictions founded on facts, upon which the prolific imagination
      of Wilfred Jacob delighted to expatiate, they had such an effect upon poor
      Hugh, that he fairly cried himself to sleep that night, from sheer
      vexation and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, a flashily dressed, sharp-looking young man, who was
      none other than the usher introduced by Wilfred Jacob into his description
      of the Tickletown masters by the nickname of Pentameter, but whose proper
      appellation was Sprattly, and who was, as Wilfred had truly stated,
      anything but a gentleman, approached a group, consisting of Biggington,
      Stradwick, and one or two others, with whom he appeared on the most
      intimate and confidential terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old fellows,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is it actually true that the Doctor won&rsquo;t
      let you go to the theatre at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, worse luck,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you going to stand it quietly?&rdquo; continued Sprattly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? why what can we do to help ourselves? If the whole of the sixth had
      stuck together, we might have made something of it; but that ass, Fowler,
      was talked over. He says Jack appealed to his feelings, or sympathies, or
      some such disgusting rubbish. So Fowler went, and took half the form with
      him; and altogether, if I was to express my true opinion, I think the
      whole affair is about as absurd, not to say disgraceful, to all parties as
      it well can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman, the speaker, was a tall, slender stripling about seventeen, with
      well-cut features and beautiful glossy hair of a raven blackness, which he
      wore long, and evidently bestowed much care upon; but his cold, grey eyes,
      and the immovable expression of his mouth, gave a clue to his true
      character&mdash;viz., a clear, vigorous intellect, but a total deficiency
      of that which is commonly called heart. He was very anxious to leave the
      school, as a rich relation, who had taken a fancy to him, and intended to
      make him his heir, had purchased for him a commission in a cavalry
      regiment, on the strength of which he affected a <i>pococurante</i> air;
      and possessing great natural powers of sarcasm, made himself feared and
      looked up to by the other boys. Outwardly he and Biggington were the
      greatest allies possible, but beneath the surface lay hidden a mine of
      envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, which only required the
      application of a match to cause an explosion, the effects of which could
      scarcely be foreseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful bore, really,&rdquo; replied Sprattly, &ldquo;for my cousin Courtenay
      Trevanion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, being interpreted, means Jack Sprattly,&rdquo; interrupted Norman,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! come, really Norman, &rsquo;pon my life you&rsquo;re too bad. I told you
      of his being my relation quite in confidence. All theatricals have a
      professional name, and a fellow may as well choose a spicy one as not,
      while he is about it,&rdquo; continued Sprattly; &ldquo;but I was going to tell you
      about to-night. They are going to do the &lsquo;Beggars&rsquo; Opera,&rsquo; Juliet
      Elphinstone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alias</i> Betsey Slasher,&rdquo; put in the incorrigible Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plays Polly Peachum,&rdquo; continued Sprattly, not heeding the interruption;
      &ldquo;Coralie, the French girl, does Lucy Lockit; and Courtenay&mdash;or Jack,
      if you will have it so,&rdquo; he added quickly, perceiving that Norman was
      again about to speak&mdash;&ldquo;Jack himself is cast for Macheath; stunningly
      he&rsquo;ll play it too, for I heard him last winter&mdash;can&rsquo;t he just tip &rsquo;em,
      &lsquo;How happy could I be with either&rsquo; in style!&mdash;Uncommon well he looks,
      too, in the highwaymen&rsquo;s dress&mdash;red frock-coat, with gold frogs, and
      high shiny leather boots; but Jack&rsquo;s a regular spicy-looking fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little too much of the lamps and sawdust about him,&rdquo; returned Norman,
      superciliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, then turning to Biggington, he said abruptly, fixing
      his piercing glance upon him as he spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big., we must go to this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, the cock of the school, who at heart was more dunghill
      than game, like most other bullies, turned rather pale as he replied in a
      low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ideas on the subject,&rdquo; returned Norman, confidently; &ldquo;but we need
      not trouble other folks with our private affairs. I don&rsquo;t exactly agree
      with Solomon about the advisability of a multitude of counsellors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re good for a spree I&rsquo;ll stick to you to the backbone!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Terry, a boy nearly sixteen, who lived only for mischief, and worshipped
      Norman, as Stradwick did Biggington, only with enthusiasm, instead of
      servility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stradwick, the remaining member of the party, was beginning slowly and
      gravely, &ldquo;I shall do whatever Big&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; when a shout of
      laughter from Norman, Sprattly, and Terry, cut him short. As soon as
      Sprattly had sufficiently recovered from the effects of his hilarity to be
      able to speak, he observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you naughty boys are determined to plot mischief, of course I
      must not hear it: only, if we <i>should</i> meet by any accident behind
      the scenes of the theatre, I shall have much pleasure in introducing you
      to Polly Peachum and the fascinating Coralie;&mdash;by-the-bye, let me
      give you a hint! that stuck-up parson, young Carrington, is a precious
      sight more wide awake than the Don, so keep out of his way as much as you
      can.&rdquo; And having thus spoken, Pentameter Sprattly carried off his five
      feet four of vulgar humanity, with the most conceited air possible of
      underbred pretensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a thorough snob that unfortunate little Pen. has improved into!&rdquo;
       observed Norman, as soon as the amiable usher was out of earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never was anything else since I&rsquo;ve known the animal,&rdquo; returned
      Biggington, surlily; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s him all the world over: he&rsquo;ll give a fellow
      information which he knows will set him raving to do a thing, and then
      come out with his humbugging, &lsquo;Well, you <i>would</i> do it; I <i>told</i>
      you you&rsquo;d get into a scrape.&rsquo; I wonder what his object now is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! merely to help his cousin, or, more likely brother. Jack,&rdquo; was the
      reply; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re as much alike as two men can be, only one spratt left off
      growing a couple of years too soon: if Jack draws a good house his salary
      will be raised. And now I&rsquo;ll explain to you my plan, as far as it is at
      present matured,&rdquo; and so saying, Norman unfolded to them a scheme&mdash;
      with the details whereof we need not trouble the reader&mdash;which, from
      his intimate acquaintance with the manners and customs of both masters and
      boys, he had been enabled to adapt to circumstances so cleverly, that even
      the cautious Biggington confessed he could only discover one flaw in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;supposing everything to have gone smoothly
      up to the moment of our return, pray how are we to get in, when every door
      and window will be carefully closed and barred, and the Doctor&rsquo;s
      six-barrelled revolver, which he is so proud of, awaiting us if we make
      noise sufficient to rouse him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ideas on that point, too,&rdquo; returned Norman, meditatively; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      certain I remember a window in that old loft over the stable, by which I
      used, when a little shaver, to get in and out through the school-room
      skylight: I must contrive to make some excuse for inspecting the
      premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who knows more about the loft than all the rest of us put
      together,&rdquo; exclaimed Terry; &ldquo;and that is little Colville: he has a pet cat
      which resides in those parts, and he is constantly climbing and scrambling
      about up there, and has the place pretty much to himself, I suspect; for
      most of the juveniles have faith in a ghost, which Hugh Colville seems too
      plucky to care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was exactly my case some ten years ago,&rdquo; returned Norman: &ldquo;find
      little Colville and send him here to me, and let us meet again in
      Biggington&rsquo;s room after morning school, when I will report progress, and
      the affair shall be finally arranged. Now be off with you different ways:
      we must not be seen talking together too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so with breasts more or less burdened by a consciousness of their evil
      secret, the conspirators parted.

      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;TEMPTATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;C</span>ome here,
      Colville. How is your cat this morning?&rdquo; inquired Norman, as Hugh
      approached, a good deal puzzled, and rather alarmed, at his summons, by
      reason of the fact that when a sixth-form boy sent for one of the little
      fellows, the interview, however it might begin, generally ended by the
      juvenile coming in for a thrashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, she is very well,&rdquo; replied Hugh; then, judging from
      Norman&rsquo;s face that no very adverse fate awaited him, he continued, &ldquo;If you
      please, sir, she caught a rat to-day all her own self; such a monster,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! she must be a most meritorious and praiseworthy animal,&rdquo; returned
      Norman; then, anxious to set the little fellow at his ease before he began
      to pump him, he continued&mdash;&ldquo;How did you like the play yesterday? were
      you very much charmed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not go, if you please, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! how was that? Did the Doctor keep you in for a punishment, or don&rsquo;t
      you care about such things?&rdquo; inquired Norman, pretty well foreseeing the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not that, sir,&rdquo; returned Hugh. &ldquo;I should have been delighted
      to go; but I had spent all my pocket money, and so could not pay for
      entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlucky for you&mdash;very,&rdquo; rejoined Norman; &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d known it
      &lsquo;sooner, I&rsquo;d have tipped you the half-crown; more particularly as I want
      you to do something for me. You know the loft well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh grinned, as he replied, &ldquo;Every inch of it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So used I when I was your age. Is not there a little square window, or
      trap door, by which one can get on the top of the school-room, near the
      part of the skylight which opens? and which can be reached by standing on
      the doctor&rsquo;s desk?&rdquo; inquired Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I often get up that way if the boys are
      plaguing me; and they don&rsquo;t dare to follow me because it is dark inside
      that part of the loft, and they are afraid of a ghost; but I&rsquo;m sure
      there&rsquo;s no ghost, or else Puss would not leave her kittens there: if the
      kittens are safe, why should not I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman smiled at this specimen of juvenile logic
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said, stroking Hugh&rsquo;s curly pate, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re plucky little
      fellow; and now show me this window. I want to see if I have forgotten the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show it to you, and willingly, sir,&rdquo; returned Hugh, whose affections
      were easily won, more especially when one of the sixth condescended to lay
      siege to them; &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t be able to get through yourself, now. You
      were a little fellow&rsquo; like me, I suppose, when you used to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information was what the immortal Dick Swiveller would have termed &ldquo;a
      staggerer,&rdquo; and for a moment, Norman began to fear his scheme was knocked
      on the head; but possessing two main elements of greatness, namely&mdash;presence
      of mind and fertility of resource, an alternative occurred to him, which,
      although by no means so safe or easy as his original plan, might yet be
      practicable. Everything depended on the character of the child before him:
      of its strong points he had already some experience, and felt satisfied
      that he might rely on them. The boy possessed pluck enough for his
      purpose: he had now to test his weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he begun&mdash;&ldquo;mind, I only say suppose&mdash;there were yet a
      chance of your going to the theatre, what should you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think! why I should be ready to jump out of my skin for joy, to be sure!&rdquo;
       returned Hugh, his eyes sparkling, and his cheeks flushing at the bare
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman had gained a step: he perceived the strength of the temptation he
      had to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after keeping Hugh in an agony of expectation for a
      minute or two, &ldquo;there <i>is</i> a chance; but it must depend on whether
      you do exactly as I wish and approve. In the first place, promise me not
      to say a word to anybody about this conversation, or even mention that I
      have been talking to you;&mdash;in the second place, come to me in
      Biggington&rsquo;s room, as soon as dinner is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, may not I tell Percy? I always tell him everything,&rdquo; pleaded
      Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell him who broke the Doctor&rsquo;s inkglass?&rdquo; inquired Norman,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this inquiry referred to a little affair which had occurred within a
      week of Hugh&rsquo;s first arrival at school. Indulging in what propensity
      common alike to boys and monkeys, viz., of examining everything with their
      fingers&rsquo; ends, Hugh had allowed to fall, and thus broken, Dr. Donkiestir&rsquo;s
      own peculiar inkglass. Overwhelmed with the awful nature of the offence he
      had committed, and expecting, at the very least, to be flogged for the
      same, the poor child sat down by the side of the devastation he had
      caused, and commenced the uncomfortable operation of crying his-eyes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this forlorn condition he was discovered by Norman, who, without being
      really kind-hearted, possessed that not uncommon species of negatively
      selfish good-nature, which leads people to dislike to look on distress,
      physical or mental. Moreover, the fact of Hugh being a very pretty boy
      pleased his taste; and therefore interested him. Accordingly, he first
      inquired the cause of his grief, and then devised a remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Norman&rsquo;s own inkbottle and the one which Hugh had just
      broken, were, as nearly as possible, similar. He knew, moreover, that the
      Doctor was by no means observant of such minor particulars. He,
      accordingly, substituted his bottle for the broken one, assisted Hugh to
      clear away all traces of the accident, and, advising him to keep his own
      counsel, left him greatly consoled. But Hugh felt a consciousness that
      there was something in this transaction of which Percy would not approve;
      and, fearful lest, in his strict sense of honour, he should pronounce it
      necessary to acquaint the Doctor with his delinquency, his moral courage
      failed him, and, up to the moment in which Norman asked him the question,
      he had never revealed the misdeed to his brother. It was the first time he
      had ever been guilty of that mildest form of lying&mdash;suppression of
      the truth; but the stone of dissimulation, once set rolling, soon gathers
      force, which the feeble hand that sufficed to put it in motion is
      powerless to restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Hugh&rsquo;s first &ldquo;little sin&rdquo; fated to prove an exception to the rule.
      Of course he was obliged to confess to Norman that he had not told his
      brother, and of course Norman replied that what he had done once he could
      do again: and that if he cared to go to the play, he must not tell Percy
      or any one; and Hugh, not having a word to say in denial, the discussion
      ended by his promising to preserve a strict silence on the subject, and to
      come to Norman in Biggington&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that same apartment was assembled, that afternoon, a solemn conclave.
      Biggington took <i>the</i> chair (there was but one); Stradwick drew a box
      from under the bed, and seated himself upon it, in an attitude exactly
      copied from that of Biggington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman, resting his elbow on the chimney-piece, remained standing; while
      Terry turned a wash-hand basin topsy-turvy, and perched himself,
      monkey-like, on the apex of the semi-cone thus created. After a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, Biggington exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Norman, how are we going on?
      have you brought your plan to perfection yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unforeseen difficulties have sprung up,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but none which
      the three Ps&mdash;patience, perseverance, and pluck&mdash;will not carry
      us through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficulties be hanged!&rdquo; rejoined Biggington, impetuously. &ldquo;I tell you
      one thing, go <i>I will</i>, by fair means or foul; the fact is,
      Trevanion&rdquo; (&ldquo;Jack Spratty,&rdquo; murmured Norman. &ldquo;With a great pair of dyed
      moustachios on him,&rdquo; urged Terry) &ldquo;has been here, and promised to take us
      behind the scenes, and to come and sup with us at the Bull afterwards, and
      induce Coralie and the other girl to come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! and Coralie&rsquo;s a stunner, and no mistake,&rdquo; observed Terry; &ldquo;such a
      pair of black eyes, by Jove! they go through a fellow like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bradawls,&rdquo; suggested Stradwick, complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>pointed</i> illustration, decidedly,&rdquo; resumed Terry; &ldquo;but I was
      walking the day before yesterday with old Beaugentil, when we met this
      said Coralie, taking a constitutional for the benefit of her complexion;
      the moment Beaugentil set eyes upon her, he went off into an ecstacy,
      throwing up his arms and capering about like a bear on hot bricks. &lsquo;<i>Mais,
      ce n&rsquo;est pas possible!</i>&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;vot shall I be &rsquo;old? <i>Est-ce
      toi, Coralie?</i> Am it thou, Coreliar, zie daugtaire of thy mama, zie
      beloafed <i>de ma premiere jeunesse! et quelle ange!</i> vot an angle! <i>vrai
      ange du ciel</i>, a right angle of &rsquo;eaven! <i>Voyez donc, Monsieur
      Terrie; permettez que je vous prÃ©sente mon cher Ã©lÃ¨ve, Monsieur Terrie,
      june homme charmant; mais n&rsquo;est-ce pas que Mademoiselle est jolie</i>; ees
      not Mees superbe, beautifu, <i>magnifique</i>, pretty vell!&rsquo; and so the
      old boy ran on till I was in fits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your confounded difficulty, Norman?&rdquo; inquired Biggington,
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the window in the loft turns out to be too small for anything bigger
      than a boy to get through,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggington muttered something unintelligible, which it would be the height
      of charity to consider a good word, as he continued&mdash;&ldquo;What do you
      mean to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a small boy through it, who shall open the back door into the
      school-room for us, whereby we shall enter and walk up to bed,&rdquo; returned
      Norman, stroking the raven down on his upper lip, where the &ldquo;cavalry
      moustache&rdquo; was just beginning to show itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what chance is there of finding a boy whom you can trust to do such a
      thing?&rdquo; asked Biggington, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is already found, or I am much mistaken,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Moreover,
      properly handled, he&rsquo;ll do the thing well, and <i>con amore</i>; I&rsquo;d
      sooner work with <i>one</i> willing agent than with twenty forced ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The younger Colville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biggington mused. &ldquo;He might do it; but his brother will not allow him,&rdquo; he
      said after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His brother will have no voice in the matter, for he will know nothing
      about it,&rdquo; returned Norman; &ldquo;but you shall judge for yourselves, for I
      have appointed the boy to come to me here. Only leave me to talk to him,
      and don&rsquo;t bully or frighten the little fellow, else you will defeat your
      own object. If, when you have seen him, you wish me to persevere with the
      plan, Biggington, stroke your chin thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Norman raised his hand to indicate the appointed signal, a modest tap
      at the door was audible, and, on the bolt being withdrawn, Hugh made his
      appearance, and, at a sign from Norman, entered. The door was closed and
      fastened by Terry, who resumed his scat on the inverted wash-hand basin,
      with the air of a monarch ascending his throne. Hugh bore the scrutiny to
      which all the plotters, Biggington in particular, subjected him,
      unflinchingly; he looked rather more grave and anxious than was his wont,
      but did not appear intimidated or abashed, though he stood in the awful
      presence of the cock of the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Colville,&rdquo; began Norman; then, as the boy approached, he
      continued, fixing his piercing glance upon him, &ldquo;have you mentioned what
      we were talking about this morning to anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the unhesitating reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to your brother, eyen? don&rsquo;t attempt to deceive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, sir, I would not tell a lie; if I had mentioned it to Percy,
      I&rsquo;d say so at once,&rdquo; returned Hugh, colouring at his assertion being
      doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; replied Norman, glancing towards Biggington as he spoke
      to attract his attention. &ldquo;I am sure you are a brave, honourable boy, who
      would neither tell a lie nor betray a secret, which is worse, if
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this commendation, Hugh&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and a bright, honest smile lit
      up his innocent, childish face, which ought to have touched the hearts and
      disarmed the purpose of those who, for their own selfish ends, were thus
      deliberately leading him into evil; it probably would have done so, were
      it not a well-established fact in pathology, that, during the phase of
      public schoolboyhood, the human heart remains in a torpid or chrysalis
      state; the animal, at that period, consisting of a head, a stomach, and
      (fortunately for those who have the control of it, as well for its future
      chance of developing into a reasonable mortal) a tail also. Not being
      actuated by any such tender feelings, or indeed by an feelings at all,
      except selfish ones, Biggington replied to Norman&rsquo;s look by stroking his
      chin. Stradwick stroked his at the same moment, giving involuntarily a
      slight shudder at the alarming future to which he was thus committing
      himself. Terry only grinned, which indeed was his invariable custom on all
      occasions, solemn or comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I am now convinced that you are trustworthy,&rdquo; resumed Norman, &ldquo;I am
      going to tell you a secret; <i>the</i> secret, in fact, upon the safe
      keeping of which depends your going to the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or getting every bone in your skin broken,&rdquo; muttered Biggington in an
      aside, which was, however, sufficiently audible to convey to Hugh a
      knowledge of the alternative which awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Biggington, these other gentlemen, and myself,&rdquo; continued Norman,
      &ldquo;mean to go to the theatre this evening, and if you will do exactly as we
      tell you, we will take you with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very point I was about to touch upon,&rdquo; rejoined Norman, in no
      way discomposed: &ldquo;the Doctor not approving of the younger boys being out
      at night, thought himself obliged to give a general order to the whole
      school; but at the same time he contrived to have it hinted privately to
      <i>us</i>, that if the elder members of the sixth form chose to go, he
      should not make any inquiries about it; the only point he insisted on
      being, that such an expedition must be managed privately, and without his
      being supposed to know anything about it. Now in order to contrive this,
      we had thought of making our way in at night (we can easily get out
      unobserved after five o&rsquo;clock school), through the window in the loft;
      but, as you say, and as I now remember, it is too small to render that
      possible,&mdash;we want you to get through the sky-light into the
      school-room (as we were talking about this morning), and unfasten the
      little door which opens into the playground; it is only secured by one
      bolt, which is not above your reach, so you can easily undo it. If you
      will undertake this, and promise faithfully not to breathe a word about it
      to anybody, you shall go with us to the play.&rdquo; Poor Hugh was sorely
      puzzled; and his sense of right and wrong entirely confused; one idea,
      however, soon extricating itself from the chaos, he immediately gave it
      utterance. &ldquo;The Doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be angry with <i>me</i>, sir,
      though he may not be so with you, for I am only a little fellow, and a
      long way off the sixth form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman hesitated; he knew that if they were discovered he should be quite
      unable to protect the child from punishment, and a sense of self-respect
      made him adverse to pledge himself to anything which he could not perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggington was trammelled by no such scruples. &ldquo;Never fear, young&rsquo;un,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;if the Doctor should by any chance speak to you on the subject,
      just refer, him quietly to me; merely say,&mdash;Biggington desired me to
      go; Biggington will explain everything;&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll have no more
      trouble from the Doctor. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Stradwick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; was the reply: &ldquo;refer him to Biggington, by all means;
      say&mdash;Biggington desired me to go; Biggington will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; interrupted Terry, grinning. &ldquo;Shut up, Slow-coach, we
      didn&rsquo;t <i>encore</i> the sentiment; moreover, I can perceive by the
      expression of our young friend&rsquo;s optics, that he is awake to a sense of
      his sitiwation. The play, a jolly good supper, and immortal honour and
      renown on one hand; and an awful thrashing from Biggington, with a gentle
      refresher from myself appended, on the other; between such a Scylla and
      Charybdis he will hardly be inclined to forestall Jack Sprattly by
      singing, &lsquo;How happy could I be with either.&rsquo; So now, young&rsquo;un, favour us
      with your sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might but tell Percy!&rdquo; pleaded Hugh, glancing appealingly towards
      Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      That individual shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will have broken the trust reposed in you, and
      proved yourself a mean-spirited, cowardly child, quite unfit for the
      service we require of you, or the pleasure with which we propose to reward
      you;&mdash;tell your brother, and you lose the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hugh! his better nature made one final struggle, but he had dallied
      with the temptation till it had obtained too firm a hold on his
      imagination to be shaken off; and so, like many folks older and wiser than
      himself, who have indulged in a reprehensible longing for some forbidden
      fruit till the appetite has grown too strong to be resisted, he fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> promise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do so want to see the play, and you
      will take care of me if the Doctor is angry, Mr. Biggington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, decidedly; both myself and Stradwick,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Stradwick and
      the Doctor are hand and glove just now, because Straddy&rsquo;s such a dab at
      Euripides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This insinuation referred to the uncomfortable fact, that the head-master
      had that morning informed Stradwick, in consequence of his total inability
      to construe the works of the ancient Greek in question, that if after
      another week he did not perceive a very decided improvement, he should be
      under the disagreeable necessity of degrading him to the fifth form.
      Stradwick, therefore, hung his head sheepishly as he echoed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We understand each other, then, and had better agree to meet here,
      prepared to start, at a quarter to six,&rdquo; observed Norman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general assent was given, and the conspirators separated. Norman glanced
      at his victim; there was a determined look in the boy&rsquo;s face, which gave
      assurance that he would go through with the task he had undertaken.
      Resolution was one of the few qualities Norman reverenced, and for the
      moment he repented the evil into which he was leading the child; but the
      two strongest passions of his nature, ambition and revenge, were linked
      with his scheme for that evening, and he could not relinquish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, little one,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand on Hugh&rsquo;s curly pate; &ldquo;if
      you and I live, and, as something here&rdquo;&mdash;and he touched his forehead
      as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;tells me will be the case, I achieve greatness, I will
      not forget this evening. Silence and courage!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;NORMAN&rsquo;S REVENGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the devil
      suggests some pleasant but wrong scheme to frail humanity, his dupes
      generally find him a most amiable and efficient patron at the beginning of
      the enterprise, however he may leave them in the lurch when the fatal
      catastrophe approaches. To give that much-abused personage his due, on the
      occasion to which we are about to allude, he adhered to his word like the
      gentleman Shakspere has declared him to be, for, as at seven o&rsquo;clock the
      very small curtain of the very &ldquo;minor&rdquo; theatre at Tickletown drew up, and
      the limited orchestra, with a hoarse, eccentric, and <i>ad libitum</i>
      bass, left off playing, four distinguished-looking young gentlemen entered
      the stage-box, and arranged the drapery in such manner that, themselves
      unseen, they might alike be able to witness the performance and criticise
      the house, which, in virtue of its being the fascinating-Courtenay
      Trevanion&rsquo;s (<i>alias</i> Jack Sprattly&rsquo;s) benefit, was crowded by all the
      rank and fashion of Tickletown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any person who had very closely observed this same box, might have
      perceived peeping from under the corner of the red curtain nearest the
      stage, a little, eager, restless, excited face, watching with the deepest
      and most engrossing interest every trifle that occurred, as though it
      presented some great and striking novelty. Had the looker-on been of a
      speculative turn of mind, he might have wondered why this little, bright
      face, which ought naturally to have expressed nothing but childish delight
      and surprise, should have had this expression marred by an anxious, scared
      look, which occasionally passed across the boy&rsquo;s intelligent features. To
      the reader, however, this evidence that Hugh Colville was feeling slightly
      ill-at-ease, even in the midst of his enjoyment, need present no mystery.
      But as the play proceeded, and Polly made her appearance, looking like a
      single angel, and singing like a whole covey of them, interest and delight
      overpowered conscience; and when Jack. Sprattly came on in jet black boots
      and moustachios, and bright red coat and cheeks, and swaggering about the
      stage as Macheath, and looking so charmingly impudent, sang in a rich
      rollicking tenor, &ldquo;How happy could I be with either,&rdquo; toll-derolling at
      the end with a devil-may-care joviality, which produced him three several
      encores, Hugh Colville&rsquo;s delight waxed to such a pitch that he mentally
      decided, if the Doctor had suddenly appeared, armed with his stoutest
      cane, and then and there varied the performance by flogging him before the
      faces of the assembled audience, the exquisite pleasure he enjoyed would
      have been cheaply purchased at even that frightful cost. Then followed a
      pantomime! Hugh&rsquo;s first pantomime!
    </p>
    <p>
      Juvenile reader whose first pantomime is yet to come, mark my words, the
      words of one who speaks from experience! You look forward eagerly, no
      doubt, to the wonderful time when you shall be a grown-up man, and do as
      you please, which you firmly believe will involve always sitting up till
      three o&rsquo;clock in the morning; riding a prancing horse all day; eating
      unlimited plum-pudding without uncomfortable consequences; and having that
      very pretty little girl next door, with whom you danced&mdash;and, in your
      small, unassuming way, flirted also&mdash;at the children&rsquo;s ball last
      Christmas, grown up into a beautiful wife for you, who will always do
      exactly what you wish with her, and never go near Howell and James&rsquo;s at
      any price. You have heard poets and other licensed story-tellers rave

      or prate of the delights of ambition; the charms of fame; the pleasures of
      hope and of memory; the satisfaction of a good conscience; or the
      inestimable blessings of domestic felicity&mdash;which, in a general way,
      means buying cradles, paying taxes, and settling bills:&mdash;you may have
      heard all this, and believed much or little of it, as your bump of
      veneration happens to be largely developed or otherwise. But what I am
      going to tell you is a &ldquo;great fact;&rdquo; and do you remember it, and act upon
      it accordingly. The happiest time of your life ought to be, and probably
      therefore will be, the glorious night on which you, a light-hearted, merry
      child, witness your first pantomime!&mdash;and you may go with my
      compliments to Papa and inform him that I say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, Hugh Colville felt strongly that until he had seen a clown
      he had been ignorant of the real dignity of human nature, or the sublime
      heights to which, properly cultivated, it was capable of soaring.
      Columbine also (as enacted by that houri, Rosetta Matilda Slammock)
      impressed him with a deep sense of the sylph-like grace and ethereal
      purity of woman,&mdash;all but the very pink calves of her seraphic legs,
      in regard to which, beautiful and praiseworthy as they were, viewing them
      in the abstract as mere bounding, pirouetting, sliding, and gliding
      machines, he could not help indulging some scruples of conscience,
      mentally classing them with unpaid-for toffy, clandestine nine-pins on
      Sunday, and the few other examples of the &ldquo;pleasant, but wrong&rdquo; principle,
      which had come within the limits of his juvenile experience; and he was
      just considering that, if Heaven had vouchsafed to place him in the proud
      and enviable position of her elder brother, he should have mildly
      remonstrated against her making such a very prominent feature of her legs;
      when to his surprise and regret, Virtue suddenly triumphed amidst ablaze
      of fireworks, and Vice being punished in the person of the Lurid Wizard of
      the Forty-locked Murderer&rsquo;s Cavern, who was dragged by three supernumerary
      fiends-to a naughty place under the stage, the curtain fell, and all was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next phase of the evening was to Hugh one strange and uncomfortable
      scene of inexplicable confusion. Biggington, Norman, and his companions,
      went behind the scenes, under the auspices of Jack Sprattly, who did not
      look nearly so brave and glorious out of his scarlet coat; and Hugh
      followed them for fear of being lost, receiving at their hands much the
      same kind and degree of attention that a little dog would have met with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all miserable, desolate, chaotic-looking places, the stage of a theatre
      in <i>dishabille</i> is one of the most forlorn. The incomprehensible
      machinery for scene-shifting, the frightful backs of all the brilliant
      effects, the dirt, the smell of the lamps, the ropes, the rubbish, the
      dangerous trap-doors, the tired, sleepy carpenters, the haggard, snobbish
      actors, and, worse than all, the pale, hollow-eyed actresses, with their
      forced, heartless laughter&mdash;a very mockery of mirth&mdash;of all
      places for destroying illusion, commend me to the region behind the-scenes
      as the most dismally effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggington, Norman, and Stradwick, having disappeared somewhere within the
      mysterious precincts of the green-room where they remained long enough for
      Terry to jump over everything, and tumble down everywhere, and set wrong
      bells ringing in all kinds of unexpected places, and have a terrific
      combat with nobody in virtue of a &ldquo;property&rdquo; sword and buckler wherewith
      he had illegally armed himself&mdash;the party re-assembled, and without
      further delay proceeded to &ldquo;The Bull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remarkable quadruped must have been, in his interesting lifetime, a
      most rare and wonderful creature, at least, if he at all resembled his
      portrait, which hung creaking on a species of jovial gibbet in front of
      the hostelrie bearing his name. The picture certainly <i>may</i> have been
      a likeness, but as it represented the bovine original got up, regardless
      of expense, in richly-gilt hoofs and horns, with his tail twisted over his
      back in the shape of a horizontal figure of eight, ending in a bright
      golden flame, while such a cluster of Hyperion curls waved over his
      massive-brow, as involuntarily to suggest the idea of his wearing one of
      those false fronts, paraded by self-deluding old ladies in the forlorn
      hope of deceiving society on the score of their undesirable longevity, we
      can scarcely conceive the artist to have adhered to nature with a proper
      degree of pre-Raphaelite severity. Be this as it may, the present
      proprietor of the Bull had exerted all his energies to provide a supper
      commensurate with the dignity and gullibility of the givers of the feast;
      and Hugh Colville&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with delight, when the goodly array of
      nice things first met his gaze; for, though by no means greedy, he was
      still almost a child, and was a hungry school-boy into the bargain&mdash;need
      we say more?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arrived Courtenay Trevanion (<i>alias</i> Jack Sprattly) and the
      young ladies, who from a strict sense of propriety, which was one of their
      marked characteristics, had refused to come unless they might be allowed
      to bring with them Mrs. Belvidera Fitz-Siddons as <i>chaperone</i>. This
      great lady, for such she was in every sense of the word, had done the
      heavy tragic business for many years with immense <i>Ã©clat</i>, until
      latterly she had grown too heavy even for that, which fact had been
      painfully impressed upon her by reason of her constantly, at harrowing
      moments of heart-rending despair, disappearing suddenly from before the
      streaming eyes of the astonished audience down traps calculated to support
      mortals of moderate (but not immoderate) weight. Finding that these
      unexpected disappearances tended to impart a burlesque character to her
      acting, rather than to increase the pathos thereof, Mrs. B. Fitz-Siddons
      had wisely restricted herself to such parts as suited her advanced years;
      and now having, by the trifling addition of sixpence weekly to his salary,
      bribed the call-boy to chalk B. T. (beware traps!) upon all dangerous
      footing, she still shone in the elderly comic line, and played Mrs.
      Malaprop and Mrs. Backbite to delighted audiences. For the rest, this
      illustrious woman rejoiced in a pair of large, bold, uncomfortable black
      eyes; a man&rsquo;s voice, slightly the worse for wear, and&mdash;&mdash;and a
      little failing she had in regard to liquor; stiff horse-hair-like curls,
      which might have been her own only that she had a harmless scruple against
      wasting money on paying her bills; and a generally hooked outline, so
      essentially Israelitish, that her green-room cognomen of &ldquo;Mother Moses&rdquo;
       appeared by no means inappropriate. Of the young ladies we will only say
      that, like <i>all</i> young ladies, they were irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at first starting, matters appeared a little dull and unpromising;
      the fact being that the two elder Tickletonians, not finding, when put to
      the test, that they were quite such thorough men of the world as they
      imagined themselves, suffered under an uncomfortable inability to make
      small talk; while Jack Sprattly, possessing a most inconvenient appetite,
      was so engrossed with the good cheer before him, that conversation, under
      the circumstances, became a physical impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the supper progressed, however, and more especially when the champagne
      (which really was not bad for Tickle-town) had made two or three rounds,
      affairs began to brighten. Mrs. Fitz-Siddons, unlike the voracious
      Macheath (which hungry highwayman still continued to demolish a supper
      more fitted for forty thieves than for one), was able to eat, drink, and
      talk at the same moment; and soon, by the cheerful, not to say jolly,
      style alike of the sentiments she expressed and of the manner in which she
      expressed them, succeeded in placing the &ldquo;young people,&rdquo; as she called
      them, upon a more friendly footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora-lee, my love,&rdquo; she began (and be it observed, parenthetically, that
      this, noble woman spoke with a slight Irish brogue&mdash;a philological
      fact to be accounted for only by the hypothesis, which she herself had
      started on a particular occasion, when she was suffering from a temporary
      nervous affection which confused her speech and imparted a slight
      unsteadiness to her gait, viz., that her mother must have been an
      Irishman), &ldquo;Cora-lee, my love! don&rsquo;t ye see Mr. Biggington waiting to take
      wine with ye; thank ye, sir, since you&rsquo;re so very pressing I&rsquo;ll not
      refuse; only up to my thumb, if you please, sir&rdquo; (as she spoke, she, with
      delightful unconsciousness, ran her thumb up the glass as the wine
      advanced, until her digit and the champagne reached the brim
      simultaneously). &ldquo;Your health, Mr. Norman, sir; O-phaliur, my darling, the
      same to the fortunes of the colville family. Go you;&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      cavalry you&rsquo;re going into, Mr. Norman, they do tell me, and it&rsquo;s an
      ornament you&rsquo;ll be to the ridgimint&mdash;fine men they are, the Lancers.
      I&rsquo;d a brother in them once; maybe you&rsquo;ll have heard tell of Major
      Fitz-Siddons? Six feet six did he stand in his stocking-soles, till he
      fell gloriously leading a forlorn hope at the siege of&mdash;of&mdash;bless
      the name of the place! now I can&rsquo;t for the life of me lay my tongue to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troy, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Terry, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belleisle, more likely,&rdquo; put in Jack Sprattly; it was the first word he
      had uttered since they sat down, and he had a largish tartlet in his mouth
      as he spoke;&mdash;swallowing the morsel, he continued in a whisper to
      Biggington, next to whom he was seated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The major was no major at all, but only a private, and was drummed out of
      the regiment for stealing the captain&rsquo;s shirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having once found his tongue, which was not until he had more than
      satisfied even his uncompromising appetite, Jack proceeded to make use (we
      can scarcely in conscience say, good use) of it, to relate all sorts of
      anecdotes, theatrical and otherwise, of which the wit was so small as
      scarcely to deserve the name, while what ought to have been the moral was
      rather the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite by accident, another gentleman connected with the theatre
      called to speak to Mr. Sprattly, so of course he was invited to join them,
      and proved a great acquisition to the party, as it was generally reported
      of him that there was no subject, grave or gay, human or divine, on which
      he could not perpetrate a bad pun; and certainly on that evening he did
      his best, or more correctly, his worst, to justify popular opinion. And
      thus a vast amount of nonsense was talked, and many bottles of wine drunk,
      until Norman conceived that the time was ripe for the execution of his
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has before been intimated that the apparent friendship existing between
      Biggington and Norman was based upon a most false and hollow foundation,&mdash;the
      truth being that the cock of the school, who was older than Norman, had,
      in times past, availed himself of his superior strength to bully, and
      impose insults and indignities upon, his junior, under which the proud
      spirit of the embryo lancer had chafed, until a deep thirst for revenge
      was excited, which he only waited a favourable opportunity to satisfy.
      During the previous year, a change had taken place in their relation to
      each other. Biggington having grown up, was, by the immutable laws of
      nature, prevented from growing any higher, while Norman, in obedience to
      the same laws, grew steadily after him until he also had attained the full
      stature of man; while, although of a slighter build, he had so
      strengthened his frame by athletic exercises, that he was now no
      contemptible antagonist even for the colossal Biggington. That the bully
      himself was aware of this fact, may be gathered from the extreme care with
      which he avoided giving Norman an opportunity of picking a quarrel with
      him&mdash;a line of policy which, until the evening in question, had
      proved most successful. Norman, although apparently enjoying himself to
      the utmost, and constantly hastening the circulation of the decanters,
      contrived to drink very little wine; Biggington, on the other hand, who
      was essentially animal in his tastes, indulged freely, until the effects
      became unmistakably apparent in his flushed cheeks and rapid, thick
      utterance. During the earlier part of the evening he had devoted his
      attentions to the amiable and accomplished Juliet Elphinstone (<i>alias</i>
      Betsy Slasher) as he found that young lady, who was of a singularly
      affable, not to say free and easy, disposition, least trouble to get on
      with; and Biggington hated trouble. But as Coralie&rsquo;s diffidence vanished
      before the influence of the champagne, and the polished compliments which
      Norman from time to time addressed to her not unwilling ears, she laughed
      and displayed her white teeth and uttered piquant nothings in the
      prettiest broken English imaginable, till she appeared altogether so
      fascinating, that Biggington began to perceive he had made a mistake,
      which the wine he drank rendered him determined at all hazards to remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman, who watched him closely, remarking this, redoubled his attentions
      to Coralie, and Biggington&rsquo;s dissatisfaction and ill-temper became so
      unmistakable that they were observed even by Mrs. Fitz-Siddons, whose
      troublesome nerves were again beginning to inconvenience her, as was
      evinced by a slight disposition towards the unromantic spasmodic affection
      popularly termed winking, with which she punctuated (so to speak) her
      sentences. Feeling desirous that so agreeable an evening should end as
      harmoniously as it had begun, she tossed off a final bumper of claret
      (Mrs. Fitz-S. was great at claret), and, turning to the young ladies,
      began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cora-lee, my love&mdash;O-phaliur, my darling, all that&rsquo;s bright my
      dears, must (<i>wink</i>)&mdash;the fondest hearts must part; &lsquo;parting is
      such sweet sorrow,&rsquo; you remember! Not another drop, I&rsquo;m obleeged to ye,
      Mr. Biggington, sir&mdash;well, if you will have it so I suppose I must (<i>wink</i>);
      we weaker vessels you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold as much as the strong ones,&rdquo; interposed Jack, &ldquo;and carry it off a
      precious sight better too, and no mistake,&rdquo; he added <i>sotto voce</i> to
      his punning friend, glancing towards Biggington as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the young ladies having risen, were looking for their
      bonnets and mantles. Terry, whose strong point was activity, had
      discovered Miss Ophelia&rsquo;s shawl, and, with many grimaces as of a polite
      monkey, had placed it over her shoulders; and Norman was about to perform
      the same friendly office by Coralie, when Biggington sprang to his feet,
      and advancing with a slight unsteadiness in his gait, exclaimed in a
      hoarse, angry voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that shawl directly, Norman; I intend to escort Miss Coralie
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; was the quiet reply; &ldquo;having found the shawl, I shall not
      yield the privilege of placing it over the fair owner&rsquo;s shoulders, to you
      or any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; returned Biggington, with an oath; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon see that!&rdquo; and
      as he spoke he grasped the shawl with one hand, while he attempted to push
      Norman aside with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing back to avoid his grasp, Norman whispered to Terry, &ldquo;Watch and see
      who strikes the first blow, and then lock the door and put the key in your
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Irritated at the tenacity with which Norman still retained his hold on the
      shawl, Biggington pressed angrily forward, when, by putting out his foot,
      Norman contrived to trip him up, while, by a slight push, he caused him to
      lose his balance, so that he reeled and would have fallen, had not Jack
      Sprattly caught him just at the critical moment. Rendered furious by the
      laugh which followed his discomfiture, and losing sight of his habitual
      caution from the effects of the wine he had drunk, Biggington&rsquo;s savage
      nature blazed forth in all its full ferocity, and, springing forward with
      a bound like that of some wild animal, he aimed a blow at Norman&rsquo;s head,
      which if it had taken effect as it was intended, would have ended the
      struggle at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Norman was prepared for such a salute, and, dodging aside, received
      the blow on his shoulder, whence it glanced off innocuously; then, before
      his antagonist could recover his guard, he rushed in and planted a
      well-directed hit on his face, in a direction which was certain to render
      him the proprietor of a black eye for the next week to come, at the very
      least. Thereupon ensued a grand shindy. Terry, in obedience to Norman&rsquo;s
      directions, having recorded in the tablet of his memory the fact that
      Biggington had struck the first blow, hastened to lock the door and
      secrete the key; having accomplished these feats, he called out, &ldquo;A ring!
      a ring!&rdquo; at the same time exhorting the combatants to take it sweetly and
      easily, and to fight fair, and like gentlemen of the sixth form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls, frightened out of their affectation, shrank into the
      farthest corner of the apartment, where they clung to each other in
      speechless terror. Mrs. Belvidera Fitz-Siddons, considerably flustered (no
      other word could express her exact state of mind so graphically), in
      trying to get out of the way, fell first over, and finally upon, a sofa,
      where, after making one or two abortive efforts to rise, she remained
      uttering incoherent ejaculations to which no one paid the slightest
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Sprattly made a feeble and futile attempt to bring about a
      reconciliation; but his friend&mdash;who, from being invariably cast as
      the benevolent uncle, or philanthropic benefactor, in all the genteel
      comedies, had, by a not unnatural reaction, acquired a sanguinary and
      democratic habit of mind&mdash;drew him back, muttering in a theatrical
      whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the serpent-brood of haughty aristocrats prey upon each other, Jack;
      there will be more room in the world for the honest sons of labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, after a short but spirited rally, the combatants came to
      the ground together, when Terry picked up Norman and gave him a knee,
      while Stradwick, frightened out of his wits (the few he possessed), did
      the same by Biggington. Five or six rounds ensued; but as Norman, who was,
      to begin with, the most scientific pugilist, appeared perfectly cool and
      self-possessed, while Biggington was furious with rage, and excited and
      bewildered by the wine he had imbibed, each round terminated in Norman&rsquo;s
      favour; he having escaped any disfiguring blow, while his antagonist&rsquo;s
      countenance already showed marks of severe punishment. When the seventh
      round commenced, and Norman again succeeded in planting a well-directed
      hit on the bridge of his adversary&rsquo;s nose, it became evident that the
      bully&rsquo;s temporary courage was failing him, and that one or two more rounds
      would completely exhaust it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the landlord of the inn and his myrmidons had been aroused by
      the noise, and were clamouring at the door demanding admission; but so
      effectually had Terry hidden the key, that Jack Sprattly, unable to find
      it, was reduced to shout to them to burst the door open. This, however,
      was more easily said than done, for the door was made of stout oak, and he
      fastenings were strong and in good repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eighth round Biggington, rendered furious by pain, pressed so hard
      upon Norman that, in avoiding his blows, he entangled his foot in the
      carpet, and stumbled, while at the same moment a left-handed hit from his
      opponent catching him on the side of his head, brought him to the ground
      so violently that, when raised on his seconds knee, he stared wildly about
      him and scarcely appeared conscious where he was; but a few moments served
      to restore him, and when time was called, he sprang to his feet with an
      expression of countenance which showed he meant mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggington, elated by his success, fought with more energy and spirit than
      he had shown in the last round or two; but in attempting to end the
      conflict by a tremendous hit, he overreached himself, and Norman, seizing
      his opportunity, drew back his arm, then flinging it out from the
      shoulder, with the force and rapidity of a sledge-hammer, caught his
      antagonist a crashing blow between the eyes, before which he went down
      like a shot, and when time was again called, he remained stunned and
      insensible. At the same moment the fastenings of the door suddenly gave
      way, and the landlord and his wife, supported by the entire <i>dramatis
      personae</i> of the establishment, appeared upon the scene of action in
      various attitudes of terror and amazement.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>rnest Carrington
      sat in the retirement of his little study, and gave himself up to thought.
      His scholastic labours were over for the day, and with a head too tired
      for mental occupation, and a heart too full of the great problem of
      existence to find pleasure in frivolous amusements, he sat resting his
      aching brow upon his hand, pondering the mighty enigma of human life in
      general, and his own individual experience of it in particular. He thought
      of the aspirations of his boyhood, of the bright hopes of his later youth,
      and mentally compared them with the dark reality of his manhood; he called
      to mind the dreams of greatness which he had pictured to himself&mdash;not
      the-false and hollow greatness of mere rank and riches, but the true
      greatness of living to become a benefactor to his species; the greatness
      which he sought when he took upon him the duties, and privileges, and
      responsibilities of his sacred calling; greatness the praise whereof is
      uttered by the lips of widows and orphans, and written on broken and
      contrite hearts, to be transferred thence, by an angel&rsquo;s hand, to the Book
      of Life. And then, for he was young and loving-hearted, he thought of
      softer, brighter visions; of a fair ideal being, with an angel&rsquo;s brow and
      a woman&rsquo;s form, who should pass by his side through life, and, loving him
      more than all things else save the GOD who gave them, to each other,
      should meet him again, and be his reward in Heaven, where perfect bliss
      could be ensured by the certainty that they should part no more. And in
      what had these bright visions ended?&mdash;a life of solitary drudgery.
      Even independence, the one thing that sweetens labour&mdash;the power of
      carrying out his own ideas of right and wrong&mdash;even that, by his
      subordinate position, was denied to him. And why was all this? What wrong
      had he committed, to deserve so severe a punishment? Why was he condemned
      to this mental prison-discipline, this alternation between psychological
      oakum-picking and solitary confinement? Nay, was not his present position,
      the result of his own unselfishness and liberality? If he had not given up
      his patrimony for the benefit of his sisters, nor relinquished his claim
      upon the entailed property, he would have possessed a fair income, on
      which he could have lived comfortably until he should have met with some
      ecclesiastical preferment, the duties of which would have afforded him the
      opportunities he sought of devoting himself to the good of others. If not
      permitted to exercise the talents committed to him to the glory of God,
      why was he born into this world at all? Poor Ernest! he had yet to learn
      that hardest of all lessons, to an eager, energetic spirit: he had yet to
      acquire belief in the great truth, that

    <p class="indent30">

      Who stand and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But his trial was more nearly ended than he was aware of even as he sat
      there late into the night, pondering on the evils of his position but
      perceiving no means of escaping from them, the very fact of his
      unaccustomed wakefulness constituted the first link of the chain of events
      which was to bring about his deliverance. Days afterwards this idea struck
      him, and taught him a useful lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great clock in the school-room had just proclaimed, for the benefit of
      the blackbeetles, crickets, and mice then tenanting the apartment, the
      interesting fact that it was two a.m., and Ernest, weary and dispirited,
      had just determined to put himself and his troubles to bed, when he
      recollected he had left some Greek exercises, which he had to look over
      before the school opened the next morning, lying on his desk in the
      school-room. Anxious not to disturb any one, he substituted a pair of soft
      slippers for his boots; and knowing exactly the spot in which he had left
      the papers, he determined to dispense with a candle. Feeling his way
      cautiously, he descended the stairs and reached the school-room without
      any <i>contretemps</i>&mdash;but here a difficulty arose, for some one had
      moved the papers. Recollecting he had some lucifers in his desk, he was
      preparing to light a taper which he kept there for the purpose of sealing
      letters, when a sound, as of footsteps in the play-ground, caught his ear:&mdash;he
      paused to listen;&mdash;the steps appeared to come nearer, till at length
      they approached the outer door;&mdash;from the sound it was evident that
      there were two or three persons. When they reached the door, they paused
      and spoke to each other in a low whisper; then Ernest became aware, from
      the altered nature of the sounds, that some one was climbing into the loft
      over the stable; his first idea was, that they were common pilferers,
      intending to steal the Doctor&rsquo;s oats; but it occurred to him that there
      might be some communication between the loft and the dwelling-house, and
      that they were burglars attempting to effect an entrance; desirous of
      obtaining a more certain knowledge before he gave any alarm, Ernest
      remained motionless, listening to the sounds without. Suddenly, a noise
      above him caused him to look up; as he did so, a small window in the
      skylight was cautiously opened, and a boy&rsquo;s head and shoulders were thrust
      in;&mdash;seeing this, Ernest stooped down so as to become hidden by the
      rails of the desk. Having reconnoitred the apartment, and imagining it
      untenanted, the owner of the head and shoulders noiselessly drew in the
      rest of his small person; then, hanging by his hands, he allowed his legs
      to drop, till, with his feet, he was enabled to reach the Doctor&rsquo;s desk,
      which was considerably higher than any of the others; he next closed the
      window, and silently gliding down the slope of the desk, by the aid of a
      high stool gained <i>terra firma</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&rsquo;s first impulse was to collar him, but on second thoughts he
      determined to wait, and let the affair develop itself a little further.
      Having reached the ground, Hugh (for of course the reader has long since
      surmised that it was that misguided child) crept cautiously to the outer
      door, and withdrew the bolt; as he did so, Ernest noiselessly crossed the
      apartment, and, when the door opened, seized the first person who
      attempted to enter. A short, but severe struggle ensued, which ended in
      Ernest&rsquo;s favour: finding himself foiled in his endeavours to free himself
      from the young tutor&rsquo;s grasp, Norman (for he it was) observed quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, Mr. Carrington, you have half strangled me: I shall not
      attempt to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care of that,&rdquo; returned Ernest drily, releasing his grasp
      on his antagonist&rsquo;s throat, though he still retained his hold on his
      collar. &ldquo;Oblige me by walking across the room,&rdquo; he continued: &ldquo;I must take
      measures for securing your companions in this nocturnal adventure, as well
      as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he conducted Norman to the door of the schoolroom which led to
      the interior of the house&mdash;this he locked&mdash;then, still retaining
      his hold on the prisoner&rsquo;s collar, he rang a bell which communicated with
      the Doctor&rsquo;s private apartments. In the meantime, perceiving farther
      concealment to be impossible, Biggington, leaning on Stradwick&rsquo;s arm and
      Terry&rsquo;s shoulder, entered considerably the worse for wear, and flung
      himself doggedly on a bench. The sound of approaching footsteps soon broke
      the uncomfortable silence which followed the capture of Norman. Ernest
      unfastened the door, and Dr. Donkiestir, followed by a man-servant with a
      lantern and a thick stick, hastily entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Mr. Carrington! Norman! What is all this? What is all this?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, as his eye fell upon the two most prominent figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words, Ernest explained his own share in the matter; then setting
      Norman at liberty, he crossed his arms on his breast, and, leaning against
      a high desk, left the Doctor to finish the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, who have we here?&rdquo; inquired the head-master, sternly.
      Receiving no answer, he took the lantern from the servant, and held it so
      that the light fell in turn on the faces of the different delinquents,
      remarking as he did so&mdash;&ldquo;Norman! I believed you to have been too much
      of a gentleman to have been mixed up in an affair of this kind&mdash;you
      have disappointed me; go to your room, I shall speak to you to-morrow.
      Biggington! why what is the matter with him?&rdquo; throwing the light of the
      lantern full upon his swollen and discoloured features, he continued&mdash;&ldquo;Why
      you&rsquo;ve been lighting, sir, and are partly intoxicated! Disgusting! you
      shall disgrace my school no longer. Stradwick! with Biggington, of course.
      At all events, I am glad to perceive you are sober&mdash;fighting is a
      vice I never suspected you of. Terry! have all the pains I have taken with
      you led to no better result than this? but I suppose you chose to copy
      Norman, even in his faults! And lastly, who is this poor child you have
      suborned to aid you in your nefarious practices? The younger Colville!
      your brother should have prevented this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hugh, his worst fears realized, had been crouching close to Terry
      (the most goodnatured of the party) in an agony of apprehension; but, at
      this insinuation, all his love for Percy, together with the innate sense
      of justice which was one of his best traits, rose up within him, and, at
      any cost, he hastened to repel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percy knew nothing of it; knows nothing yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have deceived
      him; and it will serve me right if you flog me to death, sir, but do not
      be angry with dear Percy!&rdquo; and here a burst of tears chocked his
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor was as much affected as a school-master can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;do not be alarmed for your brother; if he is,
      as you state, ignorant of this business, he has nothing to fear. You may
      all,&rdquo; he added, raising his voice&mdash;&ldquo;you may all depend upon my acting
      with the most strict and impartial justice; and now to your dormitories
      instantly. I shall investigate this affair most scrupulously to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Doctor withdrew, courteously but stiffly bowing to Ernest;
      leaving the man-servant, with the thick stick and the lantern, to see the
      delinquents safely to bed; where it is but charitable to desire for them a
      good night; a consolation we can scarcely expect them to obtain, however
      much we may &ldquo;wish they may get it.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;THE TRIBUNAL OF JUSTICE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t cannot be a
      pleasant thing to be going to be hanged&mdash;however thoroughly you may
      be aware that you deserve it&mdash;however clearly you may perceive that
      it will be for the good of society, nay, possibly, looking beyond the
      present moment, for your own good also; yet the stubborn fact must ever
      remain the same&mdash;it cannot be a pleasant thing to be going to be
      hanged!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although as the law at present stands they do not exactly hang
      refractory or disobedient schoolboys, yet there is a process analogous
      thereunto, though milder in degree, termed flogging, to which such
      juvenile offenders are occasionally subjected; and this process it was
      which, as Hugh Colville sobbed forth his penitence and remorse on his
      brother&rsquo;s neck, loomed large in the distance, and hung over him, and
      weighed upon him, and crushed him down into a very abject and desponding
      condition indeed. It was not simply the pain (though that constituted a
      large and uncomfortable item in his depression) that frightened him, but
      the publicity, the exposure, the disgrace, were more than he could bear to
      contemplate;&mdash;while Percy, cut to the heart by his brother&rsquo;s
      misconduct, yet sympathising with a bitter intensity in his dread of the
      probable consequences, could only comfort him with feeble hopes of
      commutation of punishment, which his reason belied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Hugh! how deeply did he repent having yielded to the
      temptation; how bitterly did he reproach himself for having deceived
      Percy; what vows of amendment did he register, if only he should escape
      that dreaded flogging; and how pale did he turn, and how sick at heart
      with apprehension did he feel, when the bell rang for morning school, and
      he knew that, before it broke up, his fate would be decided!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boys assembled in the great schoolroom, it was evident by their
      eager, excited faces, and by a general amount of subdued whispering, that
      the news of the <i>escapade</i> of the previous night had transpired, and
      all eyes were fixed on Norman, Stradwick, and Terry (Biggington did not
      appear); even Hugh Colville came in for a degree of observation which
      served still more to embarrass and distress him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck eight, the Doctor, followed by the other masters,
      entered; and the cloud that hung upon his brow was-without the smallest
      vestige of a silver lining, and appeared so awful and portentous as to
      strike terror into the stoutest hearts The moment prayers were ended, the
      head-master rose and said, in a clear, stern voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before school commences, I have a painful duty to perform. Regardless of
      my express prohibition, certain scholars of the sixth form have ventured
      to break through the regulations of the school&mdash;which do not permit
      any of the boys to be out at night&mdash;and have been to the theatre,
      taking with them one of the younger boys, who, on their return, was put
      through a window, and made to unbolt the school-room door, in order to
      admit them, How they employed their time after they quitted the theatre, I
      have yet to discover; but they did not return till two o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning&mdash;one of them in a disgraceful state of intoxication. As the
      whole school is aware of my orders, and the manner in which they have been
      disobeyed, I consider it salutary that they should also be witnesses of my
      method of dealing with the culprits, so as at once to vindicate my
      authority, and to mark my disapprobation of their rebellious and
      ungentlemanly conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor then resumed his seat, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;Let those whose
      names are mentioned step forward&mdash;Biggington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s breathless silence, and then, with trembling knees,
      downcast eyes, and guilty, sheepish manner, Stradwick replied, that
      &ldquo;Biggington was too ill to leave his bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Let Norman, Stradwick, Terry, and
      the younger Colville stand forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a proud, haughty bearing, Norman advanced, and placed himself
      immediately in front of the head-master&rsquo;s desk. Crestfallen and sulky,
      Stradwick shambled after him. A moment&rsquo;s delay took place ere Hugh could
      muster sufficient physical strength to tear himself from his brother&rsquo;s
      side: while Percy was near him, he felt some degree of security; but Terry
      put his arm round him, and whispering, &ldquo;Cheer up, young&rsquo;un, flogging&rsquo;s
      nothing when you&rsquo;re used to it, and I dare say the Doctor will let you off
      easy&mdash;never say die!&rdquo; half led, half carried him to the tribunal of
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the eldest, Norman,&rdquo; observed the Doctor, fixing his stern glance
      upon him; &ldquo;and I will therefore deal first with you. Whatever faults you
      may possess, I have never known you tell me an untruth, and therefore I
      shall, for the satisfaction of myself and of those around me, ask you one
      or two questions, which you are at liberty to answer or not, as you may
      prefer. In the first place, do you admit the truth of the accusation
      brought against you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the quiet self-possessed reply, in a tone neither
      disrespectful nor penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any objection to give me an account of the expedition,
      especially how you passed the evening after you quitted the theatre?&rdquo; was
      the next inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norman paused for a moment, in thought, ere he answered, &ldquo;My only
      objection, Doctor Donkiestir, would be the possibility, of betraying my
      companions; but it appears to me that as you saw and recognised us on our
      return, and are acquainted with the main facts of the case, the little I
      shall have to add will tend rather to help than to injure them. For
      private reasons of my own, I proposed to Biggington to go to the theatre
      last night, and devised a scheme by which we might accomplish our purpose;
      but the loft window being too small to admit the passage of a man&rsquo;s body,
      I bribed little Colville to accompany us by a promise of taking him to the
      play, which he had missed the other morning, forbidding him to tell his
      brother lest he should prevent him. We slipped out after five o&rsquo;clock
      school, Stradwick and Terry accompanying us; went to the theatre, and
      supped afterwards at a tavern with some of the actors and actresses;
      towards the end of the evening, Biggington insulted and struck me; I
      returned the blow, and we fought; in the last round, a hit I made stunned
      him, and it was some little time before he recovered sufficiently to walk
      back; as soon as he was able to do so, we returned&mdash;of the rest, you
      are yourself aware, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Norman had left off speaking, Doctor Donkiestir paused for a moment
      ere he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your account completely agrees with all the facts I have been able to
      acquire in regard to this disgraceful affair. You admit the truth of the
      accusation brought against you, and by your own statement confess that you
      were the originator of the scheme; you have also demeaned yourself so far
      as to quarrel with a youth in a state of partial intoxication, and as it
      appears to me, availed yourself of his incapable condition to punish him
      most severely. It has always been a chief object with me, and one in which
      I have been in many instances most successful, to induce the elder
      scholars to set a good example to the younger ones; up to the present
      time, I have been well satisfied with you upon this point; I am the more
      surprised and disappointed at your late gross misconduct. My duty is
      clear. No kind of subordination could be kept up in the school if I were
      not to visit such an offence as that of which you have been guilty, with
      the most severe punishment it is in my power to inflict&mdash;I have,
      therefore, resolved to expel you and Biggington. You may now resume your
      seat, and, when school is over, come to my study, where I shall acquaint
      you with the arrangements I propose to make for your immediate departure.
      Stradwick, have you anything to say in your defence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stradwick, thus appealed to, remained uneasily shifting from leg to leg,
      until at last he bleated forth, in a half-crying tone of voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, I went because Biggington went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the abject parasite uttered these words, a furtive smile went the round
      of the school, but the Doctor&rsquo;s face relaxed not&rsquo; a muscle as he said
      sternly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long observed with displeasure the weak and servile manner in
      which you have imitated the worst points in Big-gington&rsquo;s character; I,
      therefore, cannot do better than afford you a practical lesson how, by
      participating in his vices, you must also share in the punishment they
      entail. You I shall also expel&mdash;sit down. Now, Terry, how came you to
      be of this party? Heedless and imprudent I have long known you to be, but
      disobedient I have never before found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Terry hung his head, and a tear glistened in his clear, blue
      eye; dashing it away, he raised his face to that of the Doctor, as he
      replied earnestly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the fun and excitement of the thing tempted me, sir; and I never
      thought about how wrong it was, till it was too late for thinking to be of
      any use. I am most of all sorry to have disobeyed you and forfeited your
      good opinion, and, if you will but give me a chance of regaining it, I&rsquo;ll
      cheerfully bear any punishment you like to inflict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head-master paused ere he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take you at your word; I shall not expel you, but degrade you to
      the lower school. On every holiday and halfholiday during this half-year,
      you will remain in, and employ your time in construing and learning by
      heart six hundred lines of Greek tragedy; and, lastly, you are forbidden
      to contend for any of the prizes before the holidays. If it were not
      against my rule to administer corporal punishment to boys in the fifth and
      sixth forms, you would scarcely have escaped so easily. Resume your place,
      sir. Now, Hugh Colville, tell me the truth: did the elder boys force you
      to accompany them, or merely induce you to do so by promising to take you
      to the play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hugh! all eyes were turned upon him as, hastily swallowing his tears,
      he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biggington promised me a thrashing if I refused to go; but it wasn&rsquo;t
      that, sir; it was the play did it, sir: I did so want to see a play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment a faint gleam of pity passed over the Doctor&rsquo;s face, but had
      vanished ere he resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that I feel it impossible to look over this, your first
      offence;&mdash;you are so young a child that I believed and hoped you had
      scarcely been in a position to exercise your own free will in this
      instance; that, in fact, you had been merely a passive instrument in the
      hands of your elders; but this does not appear to have been the case&mdash;you
      evidently, being aware of my orders to the contrary, were persuaded to
      share in this expedition in order to witness a play; and you studiously
      concealed your intentions from your brother, because he, being older and
      steadier than yourself, might have interfered to prevent you from going,
      which you well knew that he would disapprove of. I consider this so
      reprehensible that, in justice, I am bound to punish you for it, and the
      only punishment likely to make much impression on one of your age and
      character, and to inspire you with a salutary dread of, and respect for
      properly constituted authority, is a flogging, which will be administered
      to you in private, as soon as morning-school breaks up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, who had listened to the Doctor&rsquo;s address as if life or death hung
      upon his words, clasped his hands together in an agony of supplication as
      his worst fears became realised; the head-master, however, who had hurried
      over the latter part of his speech, as though he had mistrusted in some
      degree his own resolution, turned hastily away, and began arranging the
      papers on his desk; and poor Hugh, finding all hope shut out from him,
      crept back to his brother&rsquo;s side, and burying his face on Percy&rsquo;s
      shoulder, gave way to a burst of passionate but silent weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Doctor&rsquo;s address to Hugh, Norman, who during the whole of his
      own examination and sentence had appeared perfectly cool, self-possessed,
      and almost indifferent, began for the first time to evince symptoms of
      uneasiness:&mdash;when the decree for the flogging was promulgated, he
      unconsciously bit his lip, and clenched and unclenched his hand
      convulsively; but when Hugh burst into tears, he rose and said in an
      eager, excited voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Doctor Donkiestir, but I believe, in fact I am
      certain, this poor child was assured that if the affair came to your
      knowledge, he should be protected from the effects of your displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By those who, for their own selfish purposes, were leading him into evil,
      I presume?&rdquo; inquired the Doctor. Norman making no reply, he continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Did
      <i>you</i> tell this little fellow such an untruth&mdash;pledging yourself
      to that which you knew you were unable to perform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not actually say so, I allowed it to be said in my presence
      without contradicting it, which amounts to the same thing, sir,&rdquo; replied
      Norman, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see that you have sufficient right feeling left to be
      ashamed of your heartless and unmanly conduct,&rdquo; resumed the head-master;
      &ldquo;and I can devise you no more fitting punishment, than to show you by
      practical experience, how powerless you are to counteract the evil
      consequences of the wrong you have committed. Your appeal only confirms my
      decision in regard to little Colville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norman had hitherto succeeded beyond his expectations in his
      cleverly-devised scheme. His object had been to secure two points: first,
      to wreak his revenge on Biggington, by forcing him into a struggle, for
      which he had been for some weeks past privately training himself under the
      auspices of a retired pugilist, who kept a public-house in the
      neighbourhood; and, secondly, to be expelled for so doing, by which event
      he should be enabled to join the regiment to which he had been appointed,
      and upon which all his hopes and wishes were just now centred, four months
      sooner than he otherwise could have done. Accordingly, till Hugh Colville,
      for whom he had taken a decided liking, was sentenced to be flogged,
      Norman had been inwardly congratulating himself on his success; but the
      fact of being unable to protect this child, to whom he had by implication
      pledged himself, wounded his pride and self-respect to such a degree,
      that, as the Doctor had truly observed, no more effective punishment could
      have been devised for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Percy had been working himself up into a dreadful state of
      mind. The reflection that Hugh, his lost father&rsquo;s darling, who had
      scarcely had a cross word spoken to him in his lifetime, and even since he
      had been at school (owing to his own watchfulness, and the rough
      good-nature of their cousin Wilfred Goldsmith), had never received an
      angry blow&mdash;the reflection that Hugh, his pet, everybody&rsquo;s pet, was
      sentenced to be flogged, was more than he could bear with equanimity. What
      could be done to save him? He glanced inquiringly towards Wilfred, but
      that knowing young gentleman shook his head despondingly&mdash;the case
      was beyond his skill; determined to risk a last appeal, he half rose from
      his seat, but the Doctor&rsquo;s quick glance detected the movement, and he said
      in a decided, but not an unkind tone of voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Percy Colville; I am doing what is best for your brother&rsquo;s
      future interests, and my decision is irrevocable. I will not hear another
      word on this subject from anybody,&rdquo; he continued angrily, perceiving that
      Percy still seemed inclined to remonstrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest Carrington&rsquo;s desk was so situated that he could not only see each
      movement of the two Colvilles, but could actually hear every word they
      spoke to each other; thus he became aware that, at the moment in which the
      Doctor addressed Percy, Hugh started, and made a manful effort to subdue
      his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Percy,&rdquo; he said, in a broken whisper, &ldquo;hush, dear, he will be angry
      with <i>you</i>. I daresay I can bear it; it&rsquo;s only the disgrace I&rsquo;m
      thinking of, and that somebody may tell mamma of it, and make her unhappy,
      perhaps.&rdquo; And here, despite his efforts, a sob choked his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest caught the import of the whisper, and at the same moment he became
      aware of a timid and appealing glance from Percy, which Hugh also
      observing, a new light broke in upon him; for the first time,&mdash;believing
      equally in Ernest&rsquo;s will and power to assist him,&mdash;a hope of
      deliverance suggested itself to him; and, with a piteous, expressive
      little face, in which every passing thought and emotion could be read as
      in an open book, he also fixed his large tearful eyes imploringly upon
      Ernest&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ernest?&mdash;in his own private mind, he had all along considered the
      Doctor injudiciously severe in regard to Hugh&mdash;he had duly estimated
      the strength of the temptation, and the poor child&rsquo;s weakness&mdash;he had
      also perceived the depth and sincerity of Hugh&rsquo;s repentance; and now his
      promise to do his best to befriend the orphan boys, and the recollection
      of the fact that he had been the involuntary instrument of Hugh&rsquo;s
      detection, recurred to him with a force that was irresistible, and
      springing from his seat, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Donkiestir, I fear the petition I am about to urge may be opposed
      to the etiquette of the school, but I ask, as a personal favour, that Hugh
      Colville may not be flogged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor&rsquo;s brow grew dark, but self-restraint in speech had long since
      become habitual to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe I have clearly signified my wish that no
      further attempt to influence me in Hugh Colville&rsquo;s favour should be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of your prohibition, sir,&rdquo; returned Ernest, completely carried
      away by feeling, &ldquo;but I have pledged myself to befriend these orphan boys,
      and I will not fly from my word; I therefore again ask as a personal
      favour that Hugh Colville shall be let off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor&rsquo;s lips worked convulsively, but by a great exertion of
      self-control he a second time restrained himself from any outward
      expression of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant your request, Mr. Carrington,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;your position as
      second master in this school necessitates my doing so. How far your having
      urged it proves you to be unfitted for that position, is a question which
      I have yet to consider. Hugh Colville, you may thank Mr. Carrington for
      your escape from a well-deserved flogging: I hope the narrowness of this
      escape may impress you for the future, and that, while under my tuition,
      you may never again merit so severe and disgraceful a punishment. And now
      let the sixth form come up to me in mathematics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the scene ended. Ernest had redeemed his word, and saved Hugh from
      a flogging, but at what amount of personal sacrifice remained yet to be
      proved.

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;LOSS AND GAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ir Thomas Crawley
      paced up and down his handsome library, a prey to anxiety!&mdash;much
      depended on the turn events might take over which he had no control, but
      which yet must exercise a great and lasting influence on his future
      career. A ministerial crisis was at hand, and the party to which Sir
      Thomas belonged would either be turned out, or would retain their position
      reinforced by a coalition with some of their opponents, and thus become
      stronger than they had ever before felt themselves. If they went out, Sir
      Thomas was prepared, cleverly and respectably, to &ldquo;rat,&rdquo; and come in again
      with the opposition; but if they remained in, he was equally prepared to
      adhere to them with the most unshakable fidelity, and to make himself as
      generally useful and agreeable as in him lay: either way he trusted to see
      his services rewarded by a baronetcy, and he was only waiting for this
      desirable consummation, to make an offer of his bad heart, and dirty hand,
      to the ugly younger daughter of a very aristocratic, disagreeable, old
      nobleman. If he succeeded in all this, he told himself he should have
      reached the height of his ambition, and mentally promised his conscience
      (for, reader, he had a conscience as well as you and I, though-we, in our
      superior sanctity, regard it as a poor limp, damaged, washed-out piece of
      goods, and look down upon it accordingly, like two fine old English
      Pharisees as we are) to give up sneaking, and shuffling, which he called
      tact and policy, and live virtuously ever after, as became a member of the
      aristocracy&mdash;thus fitting himself to proceed, <i>via</i> the family
      vault, to take possession of some equivalent for the Ashburn estates in
      another world, in regard to which he was fain to own that his title at
      present was a little&mdash;-just a very little&mdash;doubtful. What a bad
      man Sir Thomas was, to be sure! How lucky, dear reader, that you and I are
      so much better than he!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Thomas had two friends in the ministry, Messrs. Tadpole and Taper
      (the Right Honourable Benjamin Disraeli knows them, and has made notable
      mention of them in his tale of &ldquo;Coningsby&rdquo;), whose views were exactly in
      accordance with his own, <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;to take the best possible care
      of their own interests, and (whenever that purpose could be best insured
      by their <i>so</i> doing) of each other&rsquo;s also; and Sir Thomas had that
      morning received the following note, marked &ldquo;private and confidential,&rdquo;
       from his friend Tadpole:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir Thomas,&mdash;I have just learned, from an <i>unmistakable
      quarter</i>, that it is Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;s (naming the
      Premier for the time being) intention to apply to you for your living of
      Ashburn for the nephew of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the
      colonial Bishop of Boreanigger. The coalition is still quite upon the
      cards, so it would scarcely be advisable to say &lsquo;no;&rsquo; while, if they go
      out, which is more than probable, to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; would be certain to give
      offence where you would least wish to do so. I would therefore suggest
      that, if you have not already filled up the vacancy, it would be <i>most
      desirable</i> to do so without delay, and you will thus avoid the
      difficulty&mdash;<i>verbum sat</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear Sir Thomas, yours very faithfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. Tadpole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S. You will kindly bear in mind that clerkship in the Woods and
      Forests; young Grig, Mrs. Tadpole&rsquo;s nephew, is a very promising lad, and
      in good hands might do credit to his patron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas read and re-read the letter. How fortunate that Tadpole had
      ferreted out this information! but for that he might have been forced to
      commit himself irrevocably to the wrong side&mdash;horrible idea! Yes,
      Tadpole was right: the living must be disposed of without an hour&rsquo;s delay:
      who should he give it to? It must be some one without political influence
      or connection, Zest he should give offence to either party! At this
      moment, from one of those strange chances which occasionally appear to
      determine the whole destiny of a lifetime by the agency of a mere trifle,
      Sir Thomas knocked some papers off his desk, and as he stooped to pick
      them up, the card Ernest Carrington had sent in some weeks before fell
      from among them. He raised it, and regarding it fixedly, as though he were
      scrutinizing the person whose name it bore, muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Carrington, he is in the Church&mdash;why should not he do? He
      might, of course, be had at a minute&rsquo;s notice;&mdash;Â£800 a year would be
      a fortune to him;&mdash;besides, there&rsquo;s policy in the thing&mdash;I find
      North Park (a farm of some five hundred acres) is in the entail; if he
      were to get scent of it, and could obtain access to the papers, he might
      claim it any day; his boyish, chivalrous scruples are sure to wear out;
      this would bind him to me by the the of gratitude: he is just one of those
      hot-headed, romantic dispositions that are always absurdly grateful. Gad!
      I could not have hit on a fitter person; I&rsquo;ll write to him at once: I&rsquo;ve
      got his direction, somewhere&rdquo;&mdash;as he spoke, he began tossing over
      papers and letters in search of the missing direction. &ldquo;A very good
      thought,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I could see through that young fellow in a
      minute; he may be managed as easy as a child, if you only take advantage
      of his weak points. I like &rsquo;em of what they call an open
      disposition; they show you their whole hand at starting; it&rsquo;s your close,
      crafty, quiet dogs that are the hardest to deal with. I shall make a point
      with him that he gets every farthing out of that proud, haughty Mrs.
      Colville, and her conceited, stuck-up minx of a daughter; they&rsquo;ve looked
      down upon me, and never liked me, I know: they&rsquo;ll be sorry for it some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ernest Carrington, when he returned to his rooms after morning school,
      found two letters on his table. The first he opened was from Dr.
      Donkiestir, and ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Sir,&mdash;It is with considerable pain that I feel it ny duty to
      urge upon you the propriety of resigning your position, as Mathematical
      and Classical Master, at the school of which I have the honour to be
      Principal. As regards talent and acquirements, I have never before had so
      able an assistant, but there are other qualities necessary in the onerous
      position of second-master of such a school as that over which I have,
      since its establishment, presided, which are equally important. In these
      qualities, the injudicious manner in which you this morning allowed, what
      I admit to have been an impulse of generous feeling, to hurry you into a
      breach of scholastic discipline, which a more hasty man than myself might
      have construed into a personal insult, proves you to be utterly wanting.
      It is to avoid the possibility of your again placing both yourself and me
      in such a false and difficult position, that I thus reluctantly press upon
      you the advisability of your immediate resignation. When a few more years
      shall have passed over your head, maturing your judgment, and tempering
      your impulsive disposition, I can conceive you will prove eminently
      qualified for the responsible, yet interesting office of an instructor to
      youth. In the meantime, I would advise your looking out for a curacy, or a
      situation as tutor to some young nobleman about to travel. I shall have
      much pleasure in giving you unexceptionable testimonials for such a
      purpose, or in furthering you. interest, to the extent of my power, in any
      other manner you may point out.&mdash;Awaiting your reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remain, dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours very faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Hannibal Donkiestir, D.D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is my reward for my philanthropy, is it?&rdquo; was Ernest Carrington&rsquo;s
      mental comment as he finished perusing the Doctor&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;Well, I
      daresay I did wrong to interfere, but I should hate myself if I could have
      sat by and watched the expression in that boy, Percy Colville&rsquo;s, beautiful
      face, or listened to that poor little child&rsquo;s heart-broken sobs, and not
      tried to help them&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve saved the little fellow, at all
      events; no more teaching for me; I&rsquo;d sooner go out as a missionary, and
      try to wash blackamore heathens into piebald Christians than that. Well,
      now for a curacy, hard labour, and genteel starvation on Â£80 a year; never
      mind, I shall be my own master, at all events, and may do some good
      amongst the poor people: no drudgery can be worse than this
      horse-in-a-mill life I have been leading of late. A letter from Sir Thomas
      Crawley. What can he want of me? I&rsquo;ve no more birthrights to sell for a
      mess of pottage;&rdquo; and with such hard, but not unnatural, thoughts running
      in his brain, he broke the seal, and read as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young Kinsman,&mdash;Ever since I had the pleasure of making your
      acquaintance, and learning the very sensible views you hold on all topics,
      political and religious&mdash;views which agree so remarkably with my own&mdash;I
      have been turning in my mind how best I may assist you, and have come to
      the conclusion that I cannot better discharge my duty as a patron of
      ecclesiastical preferment, than by offering you my living of Ashburn, now
      vacant. The parish contains from six hundred to six hundred and fifty
      souls, and the living is worth eight hundred per annum, with a
      parsonage-house and glebe attached; you will thus be rendered independent
      of any pecuniary difficulties, and able to apply your mind entirely to
      that deeply interesting subject, the religious and social improvement of
      the labouring classes. I have only two provisos to make:&mdash;one is,
      that if you approve of the position I offer you, you will signify your
      acceptance of it by return of post (my reason for this I will explain
      satisfactorily when we meet); the other, that you promise to urge your
      claim upon the estate of the late incumbent for dilapidations in the house
      and glebe. I am sure you will agree with me, that the Church is bound, in
      this latitudinarian age, to protect her property; and I can bestow&rsquo; my
      living upon no one who will not give me a distinct pledge upon this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remain, my dear young kinsman,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate friend and relative,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Crawley, K.C.B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ernest! The revulsion of feeling was almost too much for him, and in
      his contrition for the hard thoughts he had entertained of Sir Thomas
      Crawley, he dashed off a hasty letter, full of generous feeling and
      overflowing with gratitude, in which he thankfully accepted the living,
      and pledged himself to see full justice done to the interests of the
      Church as embodied in the Ashburn Rectory dilapidations: he was sorry for
      it afterwards, when&mdash;&mdash; but we must not anticipate.

      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE ROSEBUD SKETCHES FROM MEMORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eader! dear
      reader! nay, on the chance of your being a young lady, and, therefore,
      necessarily charming, we will go the whole length of the adjective, and
      say at once, dearest reader! (of course, asking your pardon for the
      liberty, and feeling quite sure you are only too ready to grant it,
      because you are such an amiable sex) don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;(by the way,
      how very becoming that new plan of plaiting a pig-tail of your back hair,
      and twisting it round like a coronal over your front hair, is to you&mdash;it
      gives quite a Classical, Grecian, Etruscan, and all that sort of thing,
      style to your <i>contour</i>)&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think, dearest reader, that
      we have for much too long a time lost sight of, and practically ignored,
      and altogether cruelly and abominably deserted, and neglected, the Rosebud
      of Ashburn? and she all the while, in the self-denial of her nature (a
      species of self-denial, by the way, which would be very generally
      practised and become exceedingly popular, if we were but sufficiently
      philanthropic to divulge the recipe), has only been growing prettier and
      more fatally fascinating every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that dangerous, irresistible little Rosebud! There she sat, looking as
      demure as if she wasn&rsquo;t always ready to smash any amount of hearts into
      the smallest possible pieces, on the shortest notice imaginable, toiling
      busily over an absurd little crochet purse, which she was manufacturing
      literally &ldquo;by hook and by crook,&rdquo; against Mr. Selby&rsquo;s birthday, when she
      intended to present him with it &ldquo;to keep all his sovereigns in;&rdquo; though if
      he could have kept <i>all</i> his sovereigns in that pretty little folly,
      the said folly would very soon have had a sinecure, and poor Mr. Selby
      have been a ruined snob, instead of a prosperous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we do not object to mention in confidence, though we should not wish
      it repeated, that the Rosebud, albeit a most dutiful and affectionate
      daughter, had, since the boys went to school, found her life very dull and
      monotonous, and was getting decidedly &ldquo;hard up&rdquo; for excitement;&mdash;pleasurable
      excitement would, of course, have been her choice, but even a little mild
      persecution would not have come amiss, in this dearth of variety: she had
      expected Sir Thomas Crawley would have given away the living, and some
      horrid interloper have arrived to turn them out of house and home long ere
      this, but no; day after day passed by without producing even the ghost of
      an incident, and the unfortunate and victimised Rosebud was reduced to sit
      by herself and look pretty, without any one to reap the benefit thereof.
      What a cruel situation for a vivacious Rosebud!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville had been absent nearly an hour, and Emily, who stayed at
      home to get on with her crochet (for the next day was the eventful
      birthday, and she was alarmed lest her offering should not be ready in
      time), had been all by her small and pretty self, and had croched away so
      hard that she had croched herself into a headache;&mdash;perceiving this
      to be the case, she laid down her work and fell a thinking, and having
      nothing agreeable to reflect upon in the present, she began to &ldquo;try back,&rdquo;
       till she had mentally jibbed as far as the day when she, and her friend
      Caroline, had been frightened by the footpad, and rescued by an
      interesting young stranger, whom you and I, dearest reader, know to have
      been Ernest Carrington, although the Rosebud was still in ignorance of
      that fact. From sheer listlessness and want of anything better to think
      about, Emily began speculating as to whom her deliverer could possibly
      have been, and whether, by any odd chance, she should ever meet him again,
      and if so, whether he would recollect her, or she him, when it occurred to
      her to try if she could remember his features well enough to sketch them.
      Emily had rather a talent for taking likenesses, so she provided herself
      with a pencil and a piece of paper, and drew away till she had produced,
      what an auctioneer would have termed, a &ldquo;splendid portrait of a nice young
      man.&rdquo; Having accomplished this feat, she held up her performance to
      scrutinise it, drawing back her head and bending her slender neck from
      side to side, like some graceful bird, till she got the light to fall
      properly upon her sketch,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I think that is very like him,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;only it hasn&rsquo;t got quite his expression&mdash;there was something
      so calm and&mdash;spiritual, I suppose it would be called, in his look; he
      was very handsome, certainly; I wonder who he could be!&rdquo; Resuming her
      pencil, she added two or three finishing touches, then appended to it her
      initials, and the date, with the intention of adding it to a select
      gallery of portraits of remarkable ball-partners, and other heroes of her
      imagination, which reposed inviolate within the sacred precincts of her
      writing-desk; but, at this moment, the house-door opened and Mrs. Colville
      entered, so hastily that Emily had only time to thrust her portrait
      between the leaves of the nearest book (which happened to be a volume of
      Blair&rsquo;s Sermons), ere her mother had joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, you are tired,&rdquo; she said, as Mrs. Colville, hurriedly drawing off
      her gloves, seated herself on the sofa; observing her more attentively,
      she continued, &ldquo;You look pale, and&mdash;&mdash; You are not ill? Has
      anything happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville smiled faintly. &ldquo;I am not ill, darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;the
      new rector is appointed, and we must leave this house next week;&rdquo; and
      overcome by the idea of quitting the home where she had passed so many
      happy years with him who was no more, but whom she had loved, nay, <i>still</i>
      loved so well (for hers was one of those rare and true affections which
      only <i>begin</i> on earth), the widow burst into tears. In an instant,
      Emily flew to her side, quietly removed her bonnet, and then, with the
      delicate instinct of a true woman&rsquo;s nature, feeling that her sympathy
      could best be shown by silent tenderness, she gently drew her mother&rsquo;s
      head towards her till it rested on her bosom, and suffered her to weep
      unrestrained. But Mrs Colville, although on this occasion the suddenness
      of the shock had overcome her habitual self-control, was by no means a
      weak character, and she soon recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to distress you thus, dearest,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;but the
      announcement was made to me so abruptly; Sir Thomas&mdash;I do not wish to
      speak against him&mdash;but he is not a man of any delicacy of feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; interrupted Emily, &ldquo;he has no more feeling than the most obdurate
      old paving-stone that ever refused to be macadamised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has certainly not shown much consideration towards us in our sorrow,&rdquo;
       returned the widow, &ldquo;but I bear him no ill-will: he only exacts his legal
      rights, and I have no business to blame because nature has not gifted him
      with delicate perception. But I was going to tell you: Mr. Selby received
      a note from him this morning, saying&mdash;but here it is; Mr. Selby gave
      it to me to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Mrs. Colville placed the note in her daughter&rsquo;s-hands. It
      ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I have at length found a suitable person on whom to
      bestow the living of Ashburn. The new incumbent will read himself in on
      Sunday next. I presume, from the length of time which has elapsed since
      the late rector&rsquo;s decease, that his family have quitted the parsonage.
      Should this not be the case, will you apprise Mrs. Colville of my desire
      that she should do so with as little loss of time as possible. The
      gentleman to whom I have given the preferment, holds most strongly the
      same views as myself, as to the necessity of guarding against the
      deterioration of Church property, and has, at my suggestion, written to
      Mrs. Colville&rsquo;s solicitor, to announce his intention of claiming, to the
      utmost farthing, the sum due for dilapidations; which debt I depend upon
      you to see liquidated. You will oblige me by doing everything in your
      power to facilitate all arrangements the new rector may wish to make. I
      leave Ashburn early to-morrow for London; therefore shall be glad to see
      you this evening, when I can explain my intentions more fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remain, dear sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, &amp;c.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Crawley, K.C.B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cruel, heartless letter!&rdquo; exclaimed Emily; &ldquo;and this horrible new
      rector appears to be as unfeeling as his patron, but of course Sir Thomas
      lias picked out some dreadful old creature like himself; he had better
      have given the living to dear, tiresome Mr. Slowkopf than to this
      unpleasant man. But mamma, dearest, what is to become of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Selby advises my taking the cottage on the common,&rdquo; was the reply:
      &ldquo;it will just hold us and the boys, and I do not wish to quit this
      neighbourhood, at least till Percy is old enough to leave school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the plan has its advantages; it would break my heart to leave dear
      Caroline, certainly,&rdquo; rejoined the Rosebud, musing; &ldquo;the worst feature in
      the case is this dreadful new rector&mdash;I&rsquo;ve taken a thorough aversion
      to him already&mdash;it is so unpleasant to dislike one&rsquo;s clergyman! I
      know he will be horrible, I&rsquo;ve a presentiment about him, and my
      presentiments always come true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the Rosebud chatted on, partly to make up for her long silence, and
      partly to divert her mother from the sad thoughts which she could see were
      still depressing her, till Sarah coming to lay the cloth for their frugal
      meal, she tripped off to get ready for dinner, quite forgetting a certain
      portrait she had sketched; and Mrs. Colville, being of a neat and orderly
      disposition, perceiving a stray volume of Blair&rsquo;s Sermons lying about, put
      it, and all it contained, away in its proper place in the book-shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday came, and with it the new rector; he was to stay at Mr. Selby&rsquo;s
      till the rectory was ready for him. Despite her prejudices and
      presentiments, the Rosebud was decidedly curious to see him, and actually
      made a pretence to gather some flowers for the drawing-room (although they
      were to leave on Monday), in hopes that, hidden behind the great laurel,
      she might catch a glimpse of him in the act of arriving, Caroline having
      told her by what train he was to travel. But unfortunately, after waiting
      a quarter of an hour, she had just gone into the house for the
      garden-scissors, when the railway fly drove past, and her utmost
      endeavours only enabled her to catch the retreating outline of&mdash;a
      black leather portmanteau. Before she went in, however, Mr. Slowkopf, who
      in his heavy way was always extremely gallant towards the Rosebud, made
      his appearance, clad in his best suit of black (which was inferior to any
      other clergyman&rsquo;s worst), on his way to dine <i>chez</i> Selby, and be
      introduced to his new rector; and hearing from the young lady (who looked
      upon him in the light of a half-childish grandpapa, or thereabouts) that
      she wished to learn something of the appearance, manners, habits, customs,
      zoology, pathology, ethnology, and general statistics, of the illustrious
      stranger, he promised to look in for five minutes on his way home (being
      Saturday night, he should come away very early), and report progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Emily told her mamma of this arrangement, and of course Mrs.
      Colville smiled, and called her a silly little goose for not having
      patience to wait till to-morrow; adding that, for her own part, she was
      used to Mr. Slowkopf, and should be sorry to see any one else in his
      place; and then with a sigh she quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o&rsquo;clock came, and with it Mr. Slowkopf, who looked and felt rather
      peculiar, which might be accounted for by the fact that his usual beverage
      was spring water, but that, on the evening in question, he had been
      prevailed upon to drink two or three glasses of wine. Instead of creeping
      into the most lonely corner of the apartment, and finding something
      uncomfortable to sit upon, he advanced boldly into the room, and saying
      cheerfully, &ldquo;Well, you see, ladies, here I am,&rdquo; he drew an arm-chair
      exactly between Mrs. Colville and the fire, and seated himself thereupon,
      chuckling with the air of a man conscious of a good joke, but completely
      in the dark as to what might be the nature or subject thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rosebud was so deeply affected (in what manner we leave our readers to
      guess) by this unaccountable behaviour, that she dared not trust herself
      to speak; so Mrs. Colville, seeing that the curate appeared likely to
      chuckle himself to sleep without making any further attempts at
      conversation, began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Slowkopf, are your never going to satisfy our curiosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus abjured, that individual started, looked round in confusion, and then
      in some degree relapsing into his usual manner only smiling vacantly all
      the time, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I can comply with your request, my dear madam, I must inquire to
      what particular subject the curiosity to which you allude especially
      applies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Slowkopf, you&rsquo;re only trying to tease,&rdquo; exclaimed Emily,
      recovering her voice and her curiosity simultaneously. &ldquo;Of course about
      the new rector: what&rsquo;s he like? come tell us&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; replied the curate, pausing on each syllable, as if
      conversation were an electric telegraph office, and he had to pay extra
      for every additional word he uttered&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s very like&mdash;most
      other young clergymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he <i>is</i> young?&rdquo; continued Emily interrogatively: &ldquo;is he tall,
      gentlemanly, handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not, at least as far as I observed&mdash;but such things don&rsquo;t make
      much impression on me&rdquo; (&ldquo;I wonder what <i>does!</i>&rdquo; was Emily&rsquo;s <i>sotto
      voce</i> comment)&mdash;&ldquo;but I should say, he&rsquo;s not what would be
      generally called&mdash;hard-featured. I only hope,&rdquo; he continued solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      only hope that he may turn out sound: there was something I didn&rsquo;t like
      about that Hock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; returned Emily, looking very grave, with the exception of her
      eyes, which were laughing wickedly, &ldquo;incipient spavin, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mr. Slowkopf gazed at her in sheer amazement; then a faint
      consciousness of her meaning gradually dawned upon him, and he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Similarity of sound has not unnaturally misled you in regard to the
      import of my observation, Miss Emily: the Hock to which I alluded was not,
      as you conceive, the elbow-joint of a horse&rsquo;s hind-leg, but a choice
      sample of Rhenish wine, hospitably produced by Mr. Selby for our
      gratification; in regard to which Mr. Carrington was pleased to observe
      that it was not the only good thing that came from Germany&mdash;a remark
      which I conceived might refer to the German school of theology, whence, by
      logical progression, I was led to doubt the soundness of the new rector&rsquo;s
      doctrinal views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having delivered himself of this ponderous explanation, Mr. Slowkopf
      rose up as suddenly as if he had been propelled by a spring, after the
      fashion of that much-enduring public character Jack-in-a-box, and abruptly
      taking leave of the two ladies, broke his shins over a chair, and was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mamma dear, what has come to the creature?&rdquo; exclaimed Emily: &ldquo;is he
      going entirely to take leave of the few senses wherewith nature has so
      scantily endowed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too pert to him, my love,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a very excellent
      young man; and always drinking water at home, is naturally more elated by
      a glass or two of wine, than a less abstemious person would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is the secret, is it&mdash;the wretch; I shall send him some
      teetotal tracts to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;A Voice from the Pump,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cold
      Comfort for chilly Christians,&rsquo; still left: they&rsquo;ll suit his case
      charmingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, the incorrigible Rosebud tripped off to bed where,
      straightway falling asleep, she dreamed, that being in church, and the new
      rector turning out to be a fine young piebald centaur, she clearly
      perceived, as he cantered up the pulpit stairs, whisking a most unclerical
      switch tail, that he was decidedly spavined in the off hind-leg.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;AN &lsquo;ELEGANT EXTRACT&rsquo; FROM BLAIR&rsquo;s SERMONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n unfortunate
      necessity existing to compress this our veracious history of &ldquo;the Fortunes
      of the Colville Family&rdquo; within the limits of one small volume, a great
      many incidents on which we would gladly expatiate can merely be sketched
      in outline, while we must leave the reader&rsquo;s imagination to till in the
      details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst these &ldquo;fancy portraits&rdquo; must be included the pretty face of our
      little heroine, characterised by the look of astonishment with which she
      recognised, in her new spiritual pastor, the handsome hero of the footpad
      adventure, together with the becoming blush consequent upon the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another leaf of the sketch-book must be devoted to Percy and Hugh&rsquo;s first
      return for the holidays, and their delight in renewing their acquaintance
      with their kind friend and protector at Tickletown, together with the
      consequent intimacy which ensued between the cottage and the rectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new incumbent soon won &ldquo;golden opinions&rdquo; from rich and poor. Sir
      Thomas Crawley, who had wriggled himself into the new ministry, and
      obtained the appointment of envoy to the court of one of the German
      potentates&mdash;a position which he hoped would secure for him the
      baronetcy as a retiring pension&mdash;had taken up a superstitious notion
      that his success was a reward for the good action of appointing Ernest
      Carrington to the living of Ashburn; and in order still to propitiate the
      tickle goddess, he continued to heap favours upon his <i>protÃ©gÃ©</i>, till
      worthy Mr. Selby, unaccustomed to such freaks of benevolence on the part
      of his patron, began to fear the air of Germany had produced some strange
      effect upon Sir Thomas&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slowkopf, too, had gradually arrived at the conviction that Mr.
      Carrington was &ldquo;a most praiseworthy and remarkable young man,&rdquo; and, once
      assured that he had no lingering affection for modern Teutonic heresies,
      he yielded himself to the-fascinations of his rector&rsquo;s manner and address,
      and became one-of the most devoted of his admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faithful to his pledge, Ernest exacted every farthing of the dilapidations
      to which he had a legal claim; but then he took-at a valuation Mrs.
      Colville&rsquo;s furniture and live stock (comprising Samson the pony, an
      orthodox and superannuated cow, some fine old Protestant cocks and hens,
      the annual pig, and the perennial yard-dog, which latter individual always
      barked at the wrong time, <i>would</i> go to church, and howl at the
      singing-psalms, whenever he could get loose, and cost rather more to feed
      than did his new master), and, trusting to the widow&rsquo;s ignorance of
      business matters, contrived to pay a sum for these conveniences which made
      the dilapidations fall very lightly upon her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mrs. Colville was more clear-sighted than he-expected, or whether
      his kind interference to protect Hugh from punishment, of which she heard
      an account from Percy, had won her heart, certain it is that the dislike
      with which the widow was prepared to view her lost husband&rsquo;s successor,
      soon changed to an almost maternal regard for the young man who so well
      performed the duties which Mr. Colville&rsquo;s death had left unfulfilled. The
      only person who appeared insensible to the merits of this general
      favourite, was the capricious little Rosebud; but she, very early in the
      session, seceded to the opposition benches, and constituted in her own
      pretty person a formidable minority of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly two years had elapsed since our tale began, and Percy and Hugh were
      again at home for their Christmas holidays. The party, consisting of Mrs.
      Colville and Emily, the two boys, their cousin Wilfred&mdash;now promoted
      to tail coats and a stool in the paternal counting-house&mdash;and the
      rector and curate, who, having <i>happened</i> to look in, had been asked
      to stay to tea, were gathered round the fire in the snug little
      drawingroom in the cottage. There had been a pause in the conversation, of
      which Mr. Slowkopf availed himself to address the Rosebud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a singular and remarkable fact, Miss Emily,&rdquo; he-began in his usual
      deliberate manner: &ldquo;it is a most singular and remarkable fact, that,
      intimate as I have long had the-privilege of being in this family, I
      never, until this morning when Master Hugh obligingly gave me an account
      of the transaction, was aware of your having been alarmed by a footpad,
      And providentially rescued by the benevolent interference of our excellent
      rector here and as he spoke he indicated Ernest by a flap of his larboard
      fin, with about as much grace as a seal might have displayed under similar
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, what was that?&rdquo; inquired Wilfred Goldsmith, eagerly. &ldquo;Tell us about
      it, Shortshanks&rdquo; (an elegant Tickletonian sobriquet for Hugh): &ldquo;I like to
      hear of shindies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, Hugh, nothing loth, proceeded to give a full, true, and
      particular account of the adventure; which, as Ernest was aware that he
      must have derived his information originally from the Rosebud herself, he
      listened to with a quiet smile,&mdash;more particularly when he heard
      himself described asa tall and graceful young man, of singularly
      prepossessing appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a plucky thing well done, and I give you credit for it, Mr.
      Carrington,&rdquo; was Wilfred&rsquo;s comment, as Hugh concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really I&rsquo;m quite overpowered,&rdquo; returned Ernest, with an affectation of
      extreme humility: &ldquo;my poor exertions were a great deal too humble to
      deserve an eulogium from Mr. Wilfred Goldsmith.&rdquo; Wilfred, who since we
      last heard of him had altered only by becoming in every respect &ldquo;rather
      more so,&rdquo; winced slightly, for he knew that Ernest was laughing at him:&mdash;lest
      any one else should make the same discovery, he hastened to divert
      attention by attacking his fair relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been finely astonished, Cousin Emily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you
      recognised the interesting knight-errant-peeping over the pulpit-cushion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know him again directly, Emmy?&rdquo; inquired Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she did,&rdquo; rejoined Wilfred. &ldquo;Do you think she did not dream of
      the features of her gallant deliverer twice a week regularly for the next
      half year, at least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I did nothing of the kind, you absurd boy!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      Rosebud, eagerly. &ldquo;As well as I remember, I did happen to recognise Mr.
      Carrington, but I really wonder that I should have done so; for I was so
      dreadfully frightened on the first occasion, that I could think of nothing
      but the horrible man who had attempted to take my money and as the proud
      Puss uttered this slightly apocryphal statement, she gave her head a
      little pettish toss, which meant a great deal, and expressed its meaning
      unmistakably&mdash;at least so thought Ernest Carrington; and the grave
      expression of his face became graver than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of falling among thieves,&rdquo; began Mr. Slowkopf, addressing Ernest,
      &ldquo;reminds me of the last time I met you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complimentary, very,&rdquo; muttered Wilfred, <i>sotto voce</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were then discussing the subject of white lies, as they are called,&rdquo;
       resumed Mr. Slowkopf; &ldquo;now I have since recollected a passage in one of
      the sermons of that learned and excellent divine, Blair, which affords a
      curious commentary on what we are saying. I cannot remember his words, but
      you&rsquo;ll find it in the fourth sermon in the second volume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have Blair&rsquo;s Sermons,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Colville; &ldquo;they are on the
      book-shelves by you, Mr. Carrington, if you wish to refer to the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second volume, I think you said, Slowkopf?&rdquo; inquired Ernest, taking
      down the book as he spoke. Receiving an affirmative grunt, the young
      clergyman turned his chair, so that the firelight fell strongly on the
      book, leaving his face in shadow, which circumstance prevented the fact
      from transpiring, that scarcely had he opened the volume when he gave a
      sudden start, then coloured violently, and then examined the page before
      him most carefully and minutely. Having completed his investigation, he
      turned over two or three leaves, and, in his usual voice and manner, read
      aloud the paragraph to which the curate had referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Hugh, by dint of coaxing, had inveigled his mother into
      providing the materials for a bowl of snapdragon, wherein, to his great
      delight, Mr. Slowkopf was induced solemnly, heavily, and perseveringly, to
      burn his reverend fingers in fishing out almonds and raisins, which he
      invariably dropped, for Hugh to pick up and eat. Just when the fun was at
      its highest, and even Mrs. Colville joining heartily in the chorus of
      laughter, Ernest approached the Rosebud, with the volume still in his
      hand, and said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Miss Colville, do you ever study Blair&rsquo;s Sermons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have read some of them,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but why do you ask?&mdash;are
      you afraid I shall find you out if you appropriate the worthy man&rsquo;s
      ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, he appears to have appropriated something of mine,&rdquo; was
      the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and what might that be?&rdquo; returned the Rosebud, wholly unconscious
      of the dangerous ground upon which she was treading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, as Mr. Slowkopf judiciously observed, a very singular commentary on
      the subject we were discussing&mdash;white lies!&rdquo; was the reply; and as he
      spoke, Ernest opened the volume he held in his hand and disclosed to the
      eyes of the horrified Rosebud, a certain pencil-sketch, with its tell-tale
      date and initials, which possibly the reader may not have forgotten as
      entirely as the fair artist had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant a crimson blush suffused her face and neck, and turning away
      her head, she struggled successfully against a strong inclination to burst
      into tears; recovering herself, she said hastily, and in a tone which
      indicated a mixture of wounded feeling and of anger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider you have insulted me, Mr. Carrington; it is most unkind&mdash;unworthy
      of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Ernest might have replied to this especially unpleasant address, can
      never be known; for at that moment, Mr. Slowkopf, in an agony of digital
      combustion, overturned the bowl of snapdragon, and, during the confusion
      which ensued, Emily contrived to leave the drawing-room unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or other, Ernest did not sleep very well that night; and
      the first thing next morning he wrote a note explanatory and apologetic,
      to the Rosebud, and having despatched it, sat down to finish his sermon,
      but got no farther than &ldquo;Dearly beloved,&rdquo; till the messenger returned. The
      answer contained his epistle unopened, and the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Colville presents her compliments to Mr. Carrington, and begs to
      say, that as any discussion of the occurrence of yesterday evening must be
      equally useless and painful, she has thought it most advisable to return
      his note unread. Miss Colville trusts Mr. Carrington will not allow this
      silly affair to influence his manner towards Miss Colville or the boys, as
      such an interruption to an intimacy which is so agreeable and beneficial
      to them, would prove a source of deep and additional annoyance to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was very sorry for what he had done, but he saw this was not the
      fitting time to endeavour to repair the breach; so being a sensible young
      man, he let the Rosebud have her own wilful way; and when the boys
      returned to school, informed Mrs. Colville he was about to prepare a
      volume of sermons for publication, which would occupy all his leisure
      hours; and that she must not think he meant to cut her, if his visits
      assumed the angelic property of being &ldquo;few and far between;&rdquo;&mdash;as he
      said this, he observed the Rosebud&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon him with a peculiar
      expression in them&mdash;could it be regret?

      christenings, weddings, and funerals, they would scarcely have required
      the services of a clergyman at all. Indeed, carrying out the doctrine of
      self-denial logically, and to its fullest extent, we doubt whether a
      rectory might not be regarded as a superfluous luxury, a kind of canonical
      pomp and vanity, and therefore a stumbling-block to be removed from the
      spiritual highway of that super-excellent community.
    </p>
    <p>
      But writing sermons, and instilling pure and heavenly principles into the
      decidedly earthly minds of small shopkeepers and needy agricultural
      labourers, albeit a high and sacred calling, considered abstractedly and
      as a whole, is yet, taken in detail, a very trying vocation to a man
      possessing, in no common degree, a taste for intellectual pursuits, and a
      strong appreciation of refined society. Thus it came to pass that one fine
      morning (it was the 12th of August) Ernest, having written a report of a
      district meeting for the propagation of the Gospel in parts so very
      foreign that the propagators themselves would have been puzzled to find
      them on the map, leaned back in his chair and wondered how sundry college
      friends of his were getting on among the grouse, when a note in the
      Rosebud&rsquo;s handwriting was brought to him. With sparkling eyes and a slight
      accession of colour to his pale cheeks, he read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Carrington,&mdash;Mamma is very ill&mdash;how ill I do not know&mdash;and
      fear to learn. Mr. Pillanbill (do you consider him clever?) tells me not
      to be alarmed, which frightens me terribly. May I hope you will come to us&mdash;poor
      mamma is able and anxious to see you, and you will tell me whether
      anything else can or ought to be done. Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily Colville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within ten minutes after the note had reached him Ernest was at the
      cottage. Emily received him with a blush and a smile. &ldquo;How kind and good
      of you to come so quickly!&rdquo; she said. Tears trembled in her eyes. Ernest
      had never seen her look so pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of <i>you</i> to send for me!&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he
      continued&mdash;&ldquo;I hope it proves that I am forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emily hung her head&mdash;&ldquo;If you please, we will never refer to that
      again,&rdquo; she said, entreatingly; &ldquo;I was very proud and foolish, and behaved
      very ill; but you are wise enough to forgive, and kind enough to forget:
      is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ernest took her hand and pressed it warmly, nor was it immediately
      withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville was seriously ill; and having sat with her for some time,
      the rector obtained her permission to inquire whether Mr. Pillanbill would
      object to meet Dr. Twiggit, and learn if they agreed in their view of the
      case, just to satisfy Miss Colville&rsquo;s natural anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pillanbill graciously consented. Dr. Twiggit resided ten miles off,
      and had too good a practice near home to make it worth his while to poach
      upon his (P.&lsquo;s) manor for the sake of a single outlying patient with a
      limited purse. So Dr. Twiggit was summoned, and came; he was a little man,
      with a large hooked nose and an ornithological cast of countenance, as of
      a shrewd fowl. Having strutted and clapped his wings, and, so to speak,
      crowed over the apothecary and the Rosebud, and looked as if he would have
      liked uncommonly to fight Ernest for a handful of barley, he entered the
      sick-room, where first, with two little bright bead-like eyes, he looked
      clean through poor Mrs. Colville into the mattress and feather-bed; next,
      he stretched out a claw to feel her pulse; then he pecked at her to make
      her put out her tongue; then he shook his feathers and crowed over <i>her</i>;
      and then he chased Pillanbill round and out of the room for the
      consultation, which ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Twiggit</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Clear case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pillanbill</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Twiggit</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Hepatico-cerebreosistosis, first stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pillanbill.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Twiggit</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;What have you thrown in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pillanbill</i> hands prescription. <i>Hydrarg</i>:&mdash;mysterious
      cipher, looking like a 3 with two heads&mdash;<i>Rhei: pulvo</i>:&mdash;another
      cipher, worse than the first, &amp;c., &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Twiggit</i> reads&mdash;&ldquo;Hum! yes, ha! good!&rdquo; (returns prescription),
      &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be better&mdash;ar&mdash;I think that is all to-day, ar&mdash;needn&rsquo;t
      send for me unless any symptoms of spiflicatio appear, and then it will be
      too late; keep the feet warm, head cool, nourishing slops, bland puddings&mdash;but
      you know&mdash;good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the talented M.D., who was in himself a modern instance of the
      mythical relation existing between Esculapius and the cock, strutted out
      to his carriage a richer man by five-guineas than he had been when he
      quitted that vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville&rsquo;s was a very severe illness, and at one time her state was
      most critical; but, thanks to a patient and resigned spirit, and an
      excellent constitution, after three weeks of intense anxiety to those who
      watched over her, she began to show symptoms of amendment. From the day on
      which Ernest had received the Rosebud&rsquo;s summons, to the happy moment when
      Doctors Twiggit and Pillanbill took their leave, he had shown the
      unceasing affection of a son towards Mrs. Colville, and of a brother
      towards Emily. Hour after hour had he attended the sick woman&rsquo;s bedside,
      reading to her or conversing with her on those all-important subjects
      that, at such seasons, become invested with a deep and solemn interest
      which in our happier moments they too often fail to excite in our weak and
      fallen natures. And as Emily sat by, and heard the words of the inspired
      volume, rendered yet more beautiful and impressive by the correct taste,
      true feeling, and rich mellow voice of the reader; or listened, as, with a
      wisdom beyond his years&mdash;a wisdom not of this world&mdash;Ernest
      explained away difficulties, and threw the clear light of a strong and
      vigorous understanding on the great truths of our Holy Religion, what
      wonder if some of the reverence and affection, which such teaching must
      excite in every pure and gentle bosom, grew to cling around the teacher?
      Or what wonder, either, that when Ernest saw the scornful, capricious,
      half-childlike little coquette, whose sparkling beauty had charmed his
      fancy, change, the instant sorrow laid its chastening touch upon her brow,
      into the thoughtful, tender devoted woman,&mdash;the ministering angel
      beside the couch of sickness, whose gentle, never-failing tact and quiet
      power of steadfast, patient endurance, man&rsquo;s stronger, more energetic
      nature, may envy, but can never attain to;&mdash;what wonder if, where he
      had before admired, he now grew to love?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a good thing to love! So much mawkish sentimentality and bombastic
      nonsense, so many white-muslined tears and boarding-school
      sentimentalities, have been heaped around its counterfeit, that healthy
      minds not unnaturally scoff at the passion&mdash;until they feel it! and
      thus has one of the highest emotions of which our nature is capable, been
      brought into undeserved disrepute. A deep, true, earnest, unselfish
      affection, such as an honest man (&ldquo;the noblest work of God&rdquo;) is capable of
      feeling for a woman worthy to call it forth, raises, purifies, and
      spiritualises his whole being, enlarges his sympathies, and (by affording
      a new motive for exertion) stimulates his faculties, and thus causes him
      to do the work he may lay his hand to, better than he would have executed
      it without such an incentive. The Apostle tells us, &ldquo;If a man say, I love
      God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar;&rdquo; and a great truth is embodied
      in the text;&mdash;a nature capable of forming a deep, unselfish
      attachment to one of God&rsquo;s creatures, raises its possessor in the scale of
      creation, and enables him to adore his Maker and love his fellows with a
      zealous earnestness and reality, of which a self-engrossed character is
      incapable&mdash;therefore, as we began by saying&mdash;it is a good thing
      to love!
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Colville&rsquo;s recovery progressed, it was Ernest Carrington who drew
      her about in her garden-chair, and as she grew yet stronger, it was on his
      arm she leaned when, with feeble steps, she began once again to resume her
      daily walks; and as, with grateful heart, Emily watched the colour slowly
      returning to her mother&rsquo;s pale cheeks, she almost felt as if it was to
      Ernest that she owed her beloved parent&rsquo;s restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, about a month after Mr. Pillanbill had finally taken leave,
      and when every vestige of his first syllable had been swallowed, and his
      last syllable (which was a very long one) had been paid, Ernest, whilst
      waiting until Mrs. Colville was ready for her accustomed walk, had a
      letter with a foreign postmark put into his hand. Emily, who watched him
      while he read it, saw him start and change colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; she inquired, as he refolded the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is, I think you cannot any longer be anxious
      about Mrs. Colville: her health, thank God, is perfectly restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I trust so,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but why do you ask?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I must leave you for a time; and if you felt nervous or
      uncomfortable about your mother, we could arrange for Percy to return a
      week or two before the holidays&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;he might be a
      comfort to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Ernest spoke, he stooped to pick up the envelope of the letter, and
      thus failed to observe that Emily started and turned pale when he said he
      must leave her. The letter was from Sir Thomas Crawley&rsquo;s valet; his master
      was very ill&mdash;dangerously ill, he was afraid; he had been unwell for
      some time, and had gone to Baden for change of air; but instead of
      recovering, he had grown worse every day, until finally, after a long
      interview with his medical advisers, he desired Hemmings to write to Mr.
      Selby and Mr. Carrington, begging them to come out to him without delay,
      and bring with them some clever English physician. When Mrs. Colville
      appeared and learned this intelligence, she fully agreed with Ernest that
      no time should be lost in setting off; and after a few minutes&rsquo;
      conversation on the subject, the rector rose to take his leave, saying
      that he should probably start the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma has persuaded me to go for an hour or two to the Selbys this
      evening; Caroline would take no refusal, and Miss Plainfille is coming to
      sit with mamma. Shall I see you there?&rdquo; asked the Rosebud, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, farewell, dear Mrs. Colville,&rdquo; exclaimed Ernest warmly, having
      answered Emily&rsquo;s question in the affirmative; &ldquo;I leave you in very good
      hands, and expect to find you stronger than ever when I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening at the Selbys was a very pleasant one, both to Emily and to
      Ernest, only instead of two hours, it appeared to last about ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carrington, I&rsquo;m afraid I must be rude enough to ask you to step into
      my office and look at the arrangements I have made for our journey
      to-morrow,&rdquo; observed Mr. Selby, late in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I will follow you in one moment,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small apartment opening out of the drawingroom, fitted up as a
      boudoir for the benefit of Caroline Selby. In this snuggery the two young
      ladies had been looking over some water-colour sketches, but Caroline
      Selby had just been called away, and the Rosebud was left by herself. At
      that instant Ernest joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was low and tremulous&mdash;&ldquo;Emily, I have
      come to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you go already?&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I fear so,&rdquo; returned Ernest. There was a pause, and then he
      resumed, in a voice which trembled with emotion, &ldquo;Emily, we have been very
      happy of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she murmured, almost unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;you have been very kind and gentle. Emily,
      you will not forget me&mdash;will not grow cold towards me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, but her silence was more eloquent than words. At that
      moment Mr. Selby&rsquo;s footstep sounded on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> go,&rdquo; Ernest resumed: &ldquo;Emily, dear Emily! goodbye;&mdash;God
      bless you!&rdquo; He took her soft, warm little hand in his own; she allowed him
      to retain it unresistingly: he pressed it, and his heart beat quickly when
      he felt the pressure faintly but unmistakably returned. With a sudden
      impulse he raised the little hand, still imprisoned in his, to his lips,
      kissed it, and tore himself away. As he paused to close the door, a slight
      sound caught his ear: could it be a sob?
    </p>
    <p>
      How long it might have been after his departure ere the noise of
      approaching voices roused Emily from the mental abstraction into which she
      had fallen, that young lady herself never knew&mdash;it might have been
      one minute, it might have been ten. When she did awake to a sense of
      outward things, the following speech from the lips of Mrs. Selby, a
      good-natured, vulgar woman, arrested her attention:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, ma&rsquo;am, if Sir Thomas Crawley dies, which my husband fears is only
      too probable, Mr. Carrington is as likely to be his heir as anybody I can
      think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he&rsquo;ll go and marry that pert stuck-up Emily Colville, I suppose&rdquo;
       (the speaker was Mrs. Pillanbill, who owned three awful daughters,
      unattached); &ldquo;that girl&rsquo;s played her cards well, and no mistake. It was
      easy to see she set her cap at him from the first&mdash;probably
      calculated on his being Sir Thomas&rsquo;s heir all along. Oh, she&rsquo;s a deep one,
      trust her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the speakers passed on, their words became inaudible in the
      distance; but Emily had heard too much for her peace of mind. All night
      long she lay awake weeping&mdash;for she resolved, if Ernest should be Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s heir, and asked her to become his wife, she must and would refuse
      him, if the resolution broke her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Rosebud! Rosebud! beware of pride&mdash;the sin that peopled hell!

      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;SETTLES THREE OF THE DRAMATIS PERSONÃ†.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ir Thomas Crawley
      had sneaked and shuffled through life, and, by doing so with a degree of
      talent which if exerted in a righteous cause might have gained him the
      love and respect of good men, had obtained the world&rsquo;s prizes&mdash;rank
      and riches. But tact and cleverness, rank and riches, were equally useless
      to him now, for he had met with an opponent whom he could neither bribe,
      nor cheat, nor intimidate, nor cajole. Face to face with death, all his
      worldly wisdom failed him. Dying! he could not believe it&mdash;so much
      yet remained for him to do. If he could but live for two months longer he
      should be a baronet&mdash;for two years, and he might have married the
      proud peer&rsquo;s daughter, and transmitted the rank and honours he had won to
      a long line of descendants. Then, indeed, then, when he had accomplished
      his desire, then the idea of death might not have appeared so monstrous,
      so impossible. But even then he should have required a little time to
      prepare for death. Poor, self-deceived fool! as if every hour you have
      lived, every word you have spoken&mdash;ay, and every thought you have
      thought, were not preparing you for death and for eternity! It is not what
      you have achieved that will help you now; it is what you have been&mdash;what
      you are! The meek and lowly of heart will compose the aristocracy of
      Heaven; and the lame, and the halt, and the blind, who have borne their
      cross patiently, shall be its mighty ones: he who best has loved God and
      his neighbour&mdash;he whose life has been one unconscious preparation for
      death&mdash;he shall reap the reward;&mdash;else is Heaven but a mockery,
      and death, the &ldquo;long dark day of nothingness,&rdquo; the sceptic&rsquo;s idea of
      death, extinction, annihilation, is the only reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Crawley was dying; he knew it before Ernest Carrington brought
      the English physician; he knew it when the physician&rsquo;s eye first met his
      own; he knew it when Mr. Selby urged him to sign his will. But he could
      not, he would not believe it. He was weak, he said; Germany did not agree
      with him; he had worked too hard, and required rest and society: that was
      his reason for summoning Mr. Carrington. Had Selby brought the papers he
      required?&mdash;old Sir Ralph Carrington&rsquo;s will?&mdash;good! and his own
      will?&mdash;good! Let that be destroyed now, before his eyes&mdash;good!&mdash;he
      should make a fresh one when he reached Ashburn Priory. But he did not do
      so, for the very good reason that men in their coffins cannot make wills,
      and Sir Thomas reached Ashburn a corpse, and took up his abode in his
      family vault, handsomely bound in mahogany and black velvet, ornamented
      with a real silver plate, whereupon were engraved a goodly list of
      virtues, of which nobody had suspected him when living, but of which the
      undertaker always kept a large ready-made supply on hand, for the benefit
      of such of his customers as were rich enough to afford them. Nothing was
      said about his vices, perhaps because the silver plate was not half long
      enough to contain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear reader, shall you like to have a silver plate? For myself, a little
      one of Britannia metal, with &ldquo;<i>Peccavi</i>&rdquo; engraved upon it, will suit
      me well enough; but then I am only a poor author, and if any of my works
      should happen to survive me in morocco covers, I shall care little what
      sort of boards the hand that traced them lies bound in.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time Ernest was in Germany, the Rosebud was decidedly out of
      spirits, restless, and anxious; and when the news of Sir Thomas Crawley&rsquo;s
      death arrived, she became so nervous and dejected, that Mrs. Colville grew
      quite uneasy about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine morning Mrs. Selby paid them a visit, evidently full of news. It
      soon came out,&mdash;she had heard from Mr. Selby; he and Mr. Carrington
      would be home the next day; and&mdash;would Mrs. Colville believe it?&mdash;poor
      dear Sir Thomas had died without signing his last will and testament; so
      all the property would go, under a former one, to his heir, Mr. Peter
      Crawley&mdash;a very fine young man, in a large way of business in
      Manchester, though of course he&rsquo;d give up all that sort of thing now. She,
      Mrs. Selby, was only sorry on one account, he had never been able to get
      it out of Mr. Selby, he was so ridiculously close, but she was almost
      certain Sir Thomas had left Â£20,000 to Mr. Carrington in his last will,
      and he would have spent the money so well, it certainly was a thousand
      pities; but Mr. Peter Crawley would benefit, and he was such a very fine
      young man; a fortunate family the Crawleys were, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day at dinner, Mrs. Colville remarked her daughter&rsquo;s appetite was
      returning, and that she began to look like herself again; which she
      attributed to a certain quinine mixture wherewith the Rosebud had been
      victimised, and which she canonised accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest and Mr. Selby arrived when due, and the legend of Mr. Peter
      Crawley&rsquo;s heirship remained uncontradicted&mdash;nay, was confirmed, by
      that very fine young man&rsquo;s arrival, in high health and spirits, to enact
      the part of chief mourner. Ernest was much occupied by parish affairs, and
      by the arrangements for the approaching funeral (in regard to which Mr.
      Selby appeared resolved to consult him much more than he wished, or Mr.
      Peter Crawley seemed to relish); but all his leisure moments he spent at
      the cottage, and had no reason to complain of the reception he met with
      from either mother or daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in due course of time, the day for the funeral arrived. Now it is
      an acknowledged fact that funerals and weddings are the two dullest and
      most sombre occasions on which human creatures assemble themselves
      together, and are therefore equally insipid to describe; only a funeral
      labours under the additional disadvantage, that it is against every rule
      of good taste and right feeling to poke fun at it. We feel, therefore,
      that we have &ldquo;our public&rdquo; with us, when, without entering into detail, we
      beg them to consider Sir Thomas Crawley handsomely and appropriately
      interred, with the necessary amount of black crape, crocodile tears, and
      funereal foppery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the ceremony was over, Mr. Selby ate an excellent luncheon at the
      expense of the estate, to provide against the possible contingency of
      requiring the performance repeated on his own account, after a verdict of
      &ldquo;died of inanition,&rdquo; and then prepared to read the will&mdash;only, after
      searching high and low, and in every intermediate altitude, no will was
      forthcoming; so the next best thing was to inform a small and select
      coterie of ravening wolves, and daughters of the horse-leech, there met
      together in bombazine and black sheep&rsquo;s-clothing (<i>alias</i>
      broadcloth), and styling themselves relations of the dear departed (which
      in more senses than one, they certainly were), all that he (Selby) knew
      about the matter. This was&mdash;that since his accession to the Manor of
      Ashburn, Sir Thomas Crawley had made two wills:&mdash;the first
      bequeathing the bulk of the property to Mr. Peter Crawley, he had duly
      signed, sealed, and delivered the second he had never completed. That,
      when Sir Thomas, in his last illness, summoned Mr. Selby to Baden, he had
      desired him to bring with him three documents, viz., old Sir Ralph
      Carrington&rsquo;s will, under which he had originally inherited the property;
      his own completed will; and the draught of the more recent one, then
      incomplete. That Sir Thomas had carefully-perused every clause of Sir
      Ralph&rsquo;s will; then, begging Mr. Selby to take especial care of it, he
      desired him to destroy both the others in his presence; adding that they
      neither of them carried out his present intentions, and that, on his
      return to the Priory, he should give instructions for a fresh one. That he
      (Mr. Selby), declining to destroy the wills without witnesses of his doing
      so, by Sir Thomas Crawley&rsquo;s express desire, the valet and the English
      physician were summoned, and in their presence he burned the wills. The
      property must, therefore, be disposed of according to the will of the late
      Sir Ralph Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will save the reader (and ourselves) the trouble of wading through the
      mire of that most senseless abuse of the Queen&rsquo;s-English, and her
      subjects&rsquo; common sense, yclept &ldquo;legal phraseology;&rdquo; which ought to be
      rendered illegal without delay; and proceed at once to state that, in the
      event of plain Thomas Crawley (not then be-knighted) dying intestate and
      without issue, the property was to revert to the eldest son of
      Reginald-Carrington, &amp;c. &amp;c., which Reginald, as the reader may
      probably conjecture, was the &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; son of Sir Hugh, and the father of
      the present rector of Ashburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest Carrington, therefore, the <i>ci-devant</i> mathematical and
      classical master of Dr. Donkiestir&rsquo;s school at Tickletown, was now lord of
      the manor of Ashburn, patron of his own living, and owner of Ashburn
      Priory, besides, if he chose to revive the dormant title, a baronet also.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this announcement, that fine young man, Mr. Peter Crawley, said
      a naughty word, and then tried to look as if somebody else had done it,
      frowning portentously at the oldest ravening wolf, who, with the rest of
      the pack, appeared eager to turn and rend somebody, and were only
      restrained from an outbreak of ferocity by the tightness of their (black)
      sheep&rsquo;s clothing; while the Misses Horse-leech, despite their bombazine
      and flounces, cast sanguinary glances on Mr. Selby, and would probably
      there and then have fixed upon him and exhausted his vital fluid, albeit
      his personal appearance was scarcely suggestive of an agreeable esculent,
      but for the presence of the bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rosebud heard the news before she slept that night&mdash;slept, did we
      say?&mdash;poor little self-tortured victim to a delusion of the
      arch-enemy&mdash;if agonised sobs, threatening to part soul and body; if
      pale cheeks, throbbing bosom, streaming eyes, and burning brow, be signs
      of sleep, then indeed was the expression rightly chosen. Ernest also,
      either by some strange vibration of the sympathetic chain which unites
      those who truly love&mdash;(my dear strong-minded old gentleman, albeit
      you are the &ldquo;father of a family,&rdquo; and a fair specimen of the ancient Turk
      of private life into the bargain, your saying &ldquo;Pish! folly! German
      rubbish!&rdquo; does not affect me in the slightest degree&mdash;probably
      because the sympathetic link which so much offends you, does <i>not</i>
      unite our spirits, which will, I fear, always more or less effervesce
      rather than mingle, by being brought in contact with one another)&mdash;Ernest
      also, either from some sympathetic influence, or from the natural
      impetuosity of his disposition, was so restless and excited that night,
      that he determined the next day should decide whether he was to be more
      happy, or more miserable, than anybody had ever been before&mdash;except,
      perhaps, the <i>few</i> other ardent young men who have &ldquo;lived and loved,&rdquo;
       and got into desperate states of mind about it, since the days when Noah
      went a-yachting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, being aware that Mrs. Colville had usually breakfasted in her
      own room since her illness, and seldom made her appearance in the
      drawing-room till about twelve o&rsquo;clock, Ernest (as soon as he had finished
      his breakfast, and written two or three business letters, which were
      fertile in mistakes and erasures, seeing that his hand had written them
      while his mind was &ldquo;far away&rdquo;) walked down to the cottage, let himself in,
      and without announcement made his way into the drawingroom, as he had
      often done before, where, opening the door, he found, as he had fondly
      hoped to do, the Rosebud &ldquo;blooming alone;&rdquo; only that she was not blooming
      at all, but looking especially pale and washed out, by reason of the
      tempestuous night she had passed. Not but that the storm of feeling which
      had swept over her maiden soul, and left its traces behind, had added a
      depth and (if we may use the term) pathos to her beauty, which it wanted
      previously. She turned, if possible, still more pale as he entered; then,
      by a strong exercise of self-control, she strove, with tolerable success,
      to receive him in her usual manner. After a few commonplace inquiries and
      responses had passed between them, Emily, by a great effort, felicitated
      him on his accession of fortune. He smiled mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not congratulate me, Emily,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;it is a vast and fearful
      responsibility. My career would have been a simpler and happier one
      without it; but it is God&rsquo;s will to call me to a more prominent position,
      and I must not shrink from the cares and duties it will impose upon me.&rdquo;
       He paused, then with a forced smile, which most ineffectually concealed
      his agitation> continued, &ldquo;I should make but a poor advocate, I fear; for
      here am I setting forth all the evils and difficulties of my new position,
      when my object in coming here&mdash;an object in the attainment of which
      the whole happiness of my existence is centered&mdash;is to ask you to
      share it.&rdquo; He then in a few simple, truthful, and therefore eloquent
      words, told her of his deep affection for her, and of his earnest desire
      to do what mortal might, to guard her from, or to mitigate, all the
      sorrows which more or less fall to the lot of each of us, confident that,
      in striving to provide for her happiness, he should insure his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily heard him to the end without interruption, and, save that she grew
      paler, and that her features assumed a more, fixed and immovable
      expression, she evinced no sign of being in the slightest degree affected
      by his appeal. When he had concluded, she thanked him for the compliment
      he had paid her, but informed him that, although she should always regard
      him in the light of a dear and valued friend, and hoped he would, not
      deprive her of a privilege she so highly appreciated, yet that she could
      never become anything more to him than a friend&mdash;in fact, she
      decidedly and unequivocally refused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was thunderstricken! He was no coxcomb, but neither was he devoid
      of penetration; and he knew her so well.&mdash;had traced, as he believed,
      so clearly the rise and progress of her affection for him&mdash;an
      affection ripened, and, as it were, sanctified, by their joint attendance
      beside her mother&rsquo;s sick bed&mdash;that, although from a slight tendency
      to waywardness which he was aware lurked in her disposition, he
      anticipated some little difficulty in obtaining her consent to their
      union, yet the idea that his offer should be met with a calm and
      deliberate refusal, had never occurred to him even as a possibility. After
      a minute&rsquo;s pause, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved,&mdash;pained beyond expression!&mdash;nay,&rdquo; he continued,
      gaining courtage from the strength of his convictions, &ldquo;I will even dare
      to add, surprised. Emily, I cannot bring myself to believe that my offer
      has come upon you unexpectedly; you <i>must</i> have been aware of my
      affection for you?&rdquo; Receiving no answer, he continued in a sterner tone,
      &ldquo;I am then to understand that, perceiving my attachment, without returning
      it, you have led me on merely to gratify your heartless vanity, till, in
      my weak trustfulness, I have placed it in your power to inflict this blow
      upon me&mdash;a blow, the effects of which years will fail to counteract.
      It is not my pride that is wounded: the little pride I ever possessed has
      been pretty well taken out of me by the drudgery of life ere this; but
      that such deep, unselfish love, such entire boundless trust, should have
      been thus bitterly deceived, thus heartlessly rejected, and by one who
      seemed all truth, innocence, and gentleness&mdash;Oh! it is unnatural,
      incredible&rsquo;&rdquo; He sprang from his chair, and began pacing the room with
      rapid strides, then continued, &ldquo;But I will overcome it; it is unworthy to
      be thus affected&mdash;to feel thus for one capable of such deception. No!
      cost me what it may, I will crush&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, my dear sir, gently: you may crush exactly what you please of
      your own&mdash;your outraged affections, your rejected heart, or that very
      nice new hat which you purchased in your way through London&mdash;though
      that would be the most wantonly extravagant act of the three; but you
      mustn&rsquo;t crush our Rosebud, albeit she is such a heartless little tigress.
      Ay I you may well stop and look at her! You ought to be ashamed of
      yourself, Mr. Carrington! so you ought! And you a clergyman, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop and look at her!&rdquo; Why, what was there to see in that calm,
      expressionless face, that cold stoical exterior?&mdash;only that the said
      stoicism had turned out a dead failure, broken down with its would-be
      professor at the critical moment, and there she was crying her woman&rsquo;s
      tender heart out, through her woman&rsquo;s beautiful eyes, more like Niobe than
      Plato, by long odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernest perceived this, he experienced what dear Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      would call, in her very affecting third-volume style, &ldquo;a tremendous
      revulsion of feeling,&rdquo; under the influence of which he seated himself
      beside the weeping Rosebud, and taking her poor, cold, little hand, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily, dearest Emily, what is the meaning of all this? Why! you are
      making yourself as miserable as you have made me! Come, treat me as a
      friend&mdash;a brother: confide in me. You must have some reason for what
      you are doing. Tell me&rdquo;&mdash;and here, despite his best efforts, his
      voice faltered&mdash;&ldquo;tell me&mdash;your happiness is ever my first
      consideration, and, even though it involve the ruin of my dearest hopes, I
      will strive to secure it&mdash;do you love another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak; in fact, she could not just at that moment, by reason
      of the swollen state of the <i>globus-hystericus</i> interfering with the
      action of the <i>larynx</i>&mdash;to write technically&mdash;or because of
      a choking sensation in the throat, if any reader prefers the colloquial
      style; but she had very expressive eyes, and they said &ldquo;no&rdquo; just as
      plainly, or rather as prettily, as her lips could have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest felt better; if she did not love anybody else, she must in time
      love him. Such affection as his must produce a return&mdash;he knew, he
      felt&mdash;but you see the line of argument, dear reader. Well, then, what
      was the hitch? Ernest pondered; at last, a bright idea occurred to him.
      The change in Emily had taken place since the previous day. Yes, <i>that</i>
      was it! So he half muttered aloud, half thought to himself, &ldquo;Some absurd,
      romantic, generous scruple about this confounded&rdquo; (I am afraid he said
      confounded) &ldquo;fortune.&rdquo; He then continued aloud, rather in the tone in
      which he talked to the very little children in the Sunday-school,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me, dear Emily. The happiness of my life, and, as I cannot
      but hope&rdquo; (charitable hope!), &ldquo;of yours also, is at stake. I once again
      tell you that I love you, as I have never loved before&mdash;as I shall
      never love again; that I love you with the one, deep, enduring passion of
      my lifetime. And I ask you&mdash;I adjure you&mdash;for both our sakes, to
      tell me, as truly as the fact will appear on that solemn day when the
      secrets of all hearts shall be known, do you return my affection?&mdash;Emily,
      dearest, do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course she could not say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; for that would have been false;
      she must say something, for, Sunday-school manner and all, Ernest had
      become rather awful at last, so there was nothing left for her but to say
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;-which she did accordingly. That, in fact, settled the
      question; for, naturally, Ernest decided if she loved him, she must and
      should marry him; and then he elicited from her that it <i>was</i> the
      fortune, upon which he observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well: that he <i>had</i> hoped and intended to send Percy to
      college, and to buy Hugh a commission, and to build a church at
      Satanville, and to despatch a bran-new missionary to Sambobamboo, and to
      erect some very uncomfortable model cottages for the poor people, and to
      double Mr. Slowkopf&rsquo;s salary; but that if Emily persisted in refusing him
      because of-the fortune, he would that very afternoon make it over by a
      deed of gift to that fine young man Mr. Peter Crawley, and marry her on
      the Â£800 per annum which he received as Rector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, as it was quite clear that he meant what he said, and was prepared
      to act up to it, the poor Rosebud was obliged to give in, and consent to
      accept him fortune and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the interview ended as happily as it had begun miserably; and if
      Ernest didn&rsquo;t steal a kiss ere he took leave, it must have been because he
      was a clergyman, and had the fear of the bishop before his eyes;&mdash;though
      if the bishop had been a good-natured one, he would have winked at such an
      offence&mdash;certainly an <i>arch</i>-bishop would have done so!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;AND LAST.&mdash;THE MORAL DRAWN VERY MILD!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nce again it was
      Christmas-day. At Ashburn Priory the plum-pudding was a &ldquo;great fact;&rdquo; Hugh
      Colville said so, and he ought to have known, for he ate enough, not to
      say too much, of it to test its merits&mdash;at least, if there be any
      truth in the old proverb, that &ldquo;the proof of the pudding is in the
      eating.&rdquo; But there were other good things at Ashburn Priory
      beside-plum-pudding. Love and Joy and Peace dwelt there, and pure Religion
      shed her mild light upon that happy household. The cloud which had hung
      over the fortunes of the Colville family had passed away, and the silver
      lining alone remained to testify that, although
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;In every life some rain must fall,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Some days be dark and dreary,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>yet</i> that rain falls only to fertilise the ground, and enable it to
      bring forth fruit and flowers; and the metaphor holds good in the case
      before us. The sorrow which had fallen upon the Colville family had been a
      chastening sorrow, and its effects were to be recognised in a goodly crop
      of virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud and sensitive disposition of Percy had been strengthened and
      fitted for intercourse with the every-day world, by the rough teaching of
      the commercial-school, and he was about to enter on his Oxford career, a
      wiser and a better man than a more refined mode of education would have
      rendered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s volatile and impetuous disposition had been also favourably acted
      upon, by the misfortune which caused him to be placed under Doctor
      Donkiestir&rsquo;s firm and judicious rule; and he had learned one essential
      requisite for a soldier&rsquo;s profession, on which, since he had been to spend
      a day with Norman (now a captain in the &mdash;th Lancers) at the
      Flatville Barracks, he had set his heart, viz., obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Colville was almost perfect when we were first introduced to her; but
      the loss of one she had loved so well had taught her to place her
      affections still more firmly on &ldquo;things above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the Rosebud&mdash;bless her!&mdash;all that the cloud had done for
      her was to make her the most charming little wife that ever has been, or
      ever will be; and if Ernest Carrington had not thought so, and doated upon
      her accordingly, we would, even at this eleventh hour of our tale, have
      procured her a divorce, and married her to a duke. But if we had been
      compelled to take so decided a step, we should have been sorely puzzled
      how to dispose of an autocratic and imperative baby, with a loud soprano
      voice, a decidedly dangerous temper, and a general tipsiness of
      appearance, which had established itself at the Priory, and was said by
      everybody to be the image of its parents&mdash;a statement which, unlike
      the plum-pudding of immortal memory, was not a great fact, but to speak
      mildly, an enormous&mdash; &rsquo;tother thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      If any one cares to know what became of Mr. Slowkopf, we beg to state that
      after Emily&rsquo;s marriage, he grew day by day more and more heavy and
      dejected, till at last he&mdash;died of a broken heart?&mdash;by no means&mdash;married
      Caroline Selby, on the principle of the Persian saying: that if she wasn&rsquo;t
      the Rose (bud), she had dwelt near the Rose (bud). Moreover, they are very
      happy together, and live at the Rectory; Ernest having, on Mr. Slowkopf&rsquo;s
      marriage, resigned the living in his favour, although he still generally
      preaches once every Sunday in Ash-burn Church, and once at the new
      chapel-of-ease at Satanville; for, in Ernest, riches had wrought no
      change, save, that by enabling him to extend his charities, his sphere of
      usefulness was enlarged. His darling wish is now fulfilled: he is free to
      devote his whole time and talents to the welfare of others; and his
      position, as both lord of the manor and spiritual pastor, affords him
      opportunities for carrying out his schemes for the amelioration, moral and
      physical, of the labouring classes, with a degree of success which few
      philanthropists are so fortunate as to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, our tale is told. Should it assist you to while away some rainy
      morning of life, and at the same time lead you to remember that, above the
      clouds which lour so heavily, the blue heaven lies in its deep
      tranquillity, and the glorious sun still shines brightly, able, when it
      shall be God&rsquo;s good pleasure, to dispel the darkness that oppresses you,
      and again shed its light and warmth into your spirit&mdash;the end for
      which this sketch has been traced will be answered.

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
